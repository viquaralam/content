It is that very freedom that has allowed the Internet as well as the Web to grow so quickly and to be a place where almost limitless information can be found and exchanged easily.</strong></p class="lead">
								<hr>
								<p>Since the system itself is so free and open, the Internet and the Web offer users and their computers no protection from malware found on the Web, from damaging programs sent over the Internet or from the people and groups who create them.</p>
								<p>It is up to each user to protect his or her computer. Companies, libraries, schools and other organizations set up these protections for all of the computers within them. At home, individual users must do this for themselves.</p>
								<p>Let's start with learning about malware and other threats found on the Web and the Internet.</p>

							<h4>Internet and Web Threats</h4>
							<p>Your computer and the data stored in it are vulnerable to harm or destruction from malicious (intentionally harmful, hurtful) programs and software that can be found on the Web or sent over email. There are many different types of these harmful programs and software and more are always being created. A common term for them is malware. <strong>Malware</strong> literally means malicious software whose only purpose is to cause harm or destruction to your computer and the data in it.</p>	
							<p>There are many kinds of malware. Common types are: viruses, worms, Trojan horses, spyware and many more.</p>	
							<p>One of the most common types of malware is a <strong>virus</strong>. A virus is created by a human programmer (person who creates and writes programs) who intentionally makes it for damaging and destructive purposes. Another name for these people is hacker. A <strong>hacker</strong> is a computer programmer or expert one who illegally accesses and tampers with computer programs and data.</p>	
							<p>The least serious virus is one that makes more copies of itself, while the most serious virus can erase disks, drives and/or destroy data or even hardware.</p>	
							<p>A virus is usually hidden in an application program that may be transmitted through email or by accessing the Internet. <strong>It is important not to double click on any file (particularly one with a file extension of .exe) transmitted through email unless you are certain of the contents.</strong></p>	
							<p>Many times email address books are used to spread the virus, so even if you know the sender of an email, make certain you check with the sender if you are asked to click on an attachment with a file extension of .exe.</p>	
							<p>Remember that a file with an extension of .exe is a file that begins running when you double click on it. In addition files with a file extension of .zip are compressed (files that have a lot of data are compressed to make them easier to send over the Internet) files and automatically decompress when you double click on them. Be cautious of clicking on them as well.</p>	
							<p>Other malware can open up your computer to remote access by other users, can give access to information about bank accounts, credit cards and other personal data, cause email to be sent from your account, delete files and folders and cause your computer function really slowly and poorly or to stop functioning altogether.</p>	
							<p>You can get these viruses and malware from an email or from a Web site that has been set up for just this purpose. Sometimes Web sites or ads on Web sites are really just covers for viruses and malware.</p>
							<p>If your computer is ever the victim of malware, your computer is considered <strong>infected</strong>. There are programs and software that can remove the malware. But even so, sometimes there is damage to your data that cannot be fixed.</p>
							<p>Can you protect you computer and your data from hackers and malware? Yes, you can; let's learn about that.</p>

							<h4>Protecting Your Computer and Your Data</h4>
							<p>At home and at work, there are good ways to keep your computer safe from malware. One of the most common protections is called a firewall.</p>
							<p>A <strong>firewall</strong> blocks destructive or harmful malware, other programs and hackers from gaining access to your computer or computer network. A firewall can either be a software program or a hardware device.</p>
							<p><strong>Software firewalls</strong> are programs that you install on your computer. They can be set up with "default-deny"ù rules which block all incoming information (email, attachments etc) by default and ask or "prompt"ù you to give permission to allow the information to pass to your computer.</p>
							<p>However, this setup can become time consuming on the user, so instead of "default-deny"ù rules, may programs offer "default-allow" rules. <strong>"Default-allow"</strong> rules allow traffic into the computer or network unless specifically blocked by the user; however, "default-allow"ù setups are also more risky and leave your computer and its data more open to attack. As the user, you choose how much protection to have. The stronger the firewall, the greater the protection, however, it also means less freedom and less openness in regards to Internet and Web access.</p>
							<p>A <strong>hardware firewall</strong> is a router that also acts as a firewall. <strong>Routers</strong> are hardware that is located where two or more networks connect, like where your computer connects to the Internet. Routers forward data where it needs to go. Routers can be set up to act as a firewall as well and many do.</p>
							<p>Routers can provide both wired and wireless connections for the computers connected to them. Wireless routers are not as secure as wired ones. Inexpensive routers can be purchased that allow one or more computers to connect to a single Internet connection. The router connects to the Internet directly and all devices within the home can be connected to the router; therefore the router acts as a safeguard between the Internet and the Local Area Network (LAN). The router obtains the IP address that is exposed to the Internet, not the computer(s) connected to the router.</p>
							<p>However, many <strong>Wi-Fi</strong> (short for <strong>wi</strong>reless <strong>fi</strong>delity and often used to mean a wireless connection) networks are not well secured with passwords and encryption. Someone down the street with a wireless network interface card (NIC) could access the unsecured wi-fi network to connect to the Internet.</p>
							<p>If you are going to connect to any public network such as the Internet, it is important to have anti-virus software running on your computer and to install updates regularly. There are many varieties of good virus protection software available, including free software such as AVG Anti- virus found at <a href="http://www.avg.com">http://www.avg.com</a>. Many of these programs automatically update when you turn on your computer.</p>
