<p class="lead"><strong>Charts are a visual representation of numerical data and information. </strong></p class="lead">
	


<p><strong>Charts</strong> are also called <strong>graphs</strong>. Using the spreadsheets program, you can create charts in order to view and present the numerical data in a worksheet in a different way.</p>

<p>Charts can help the user to see patterns and trends in the data more easily because it creates a picture. There are different types of charts that you can create in spreadsheets. Because each type of chart shows the data in a different way, some charts are better than others in showing the data the way you want. First, let’s look at the five most common types of charts used in spreadsheets. The most commonly used are: <strong>Line Chart, Column Chart, Scatter Chart, Pie Chart and Bar Chart</strong>. </p>

<h4>Common Types of Charts and Their Use</h4>

<p>Each of the charts in the examples below shows the same data. Each shows the monthly cost that an employee pays for insurance and it shows how the cost has changed for five years, from 2008 to 2012.</p>


<img class="img-wrap style1" src="images/spreadsheets/linechart.jpg" alt="">
<div class="caption2"><strong>Line Chart</strong> shows or tracks trends or changes over time. It is better than bar or column when changes are small and is good for comparing more than one group of data.
</div>

<img class="img-wrap style1" src="images/spreadsheets/scatterchart.jpg" alt="">
<div class="caption2"><strong>Scatter Chart</strong> shows relationships between different data. It can show changes over time and you can look for patterns where points of data bunch together to discover relationships.

</div>

<img class="img-wrap style1" src="images/spreadsheets/barchart.jpg" alt="">
<div class="caption2"><strong>Bar Chart</strong> shows or tracks changes over time. It is better to use when changes are big and can be used to compare more than one group of data. It is the same as the column chart only in a different direction.
</div>

<img class="img-wrap style1" src="images/spreadsheets/columnchart.jpg" alt="">
<div class="caption2"><strong>Column Chart</strong> shows or tracks changes over time. It is better to use when changes are big and can be used to compare more than one group of data. It is also good for when you have few categories.

</div>



<img class="img-wrap style1" src="images/spreadsheets/piechart.jpg" alt="">
<div class="caption2"><strong>Pie Chart</strong> compare parts to whole. It does not show changes over time.
</div>
<hr>

<p>In all of the charts (except the pie chart), notice that the data is presented in a rectangular, grid-like format with the years listed on one arm (side) of the rectangle and the amounts listed on the other arm (side).</p> 

<p>Each arm in these charts is called an <strong>axis</strong> and you can see that each chart has two arms (or axes). These arms are called the <strong>x-axis</strong> and the <strong>y-axis</strong>. </p>

<p>The <strong>x-axis</strong> is the horizontal (left to right) arm and the <strong>y-axis</strong> is the vertical (up and down) arm.</p> 

<p>Here in these five examples of the most common charts, you see the same numerical data represented differently in each one. Notice that some of the types of charts are more helpful in showing the data than others. For example, the column chart shows very clearly how the cost of insurance has gone up each year; looking at the <strong>Pie chart</strong>, this is much harder to see.</p>

<p>Look at the <strong>Column Chart</strong> and the <strong>Bar Chart</strong>; they are very similar. The Column Chart shows the data in solid vertical (up and down) columns and the Bar Chart shows it in solid horizontal (left to right) bars that look just like the columns on their sides. </p>

<p>Notice that the <strong>Line Chart</strong> and the <strong>Scatter Chart</strong> are also very similar. The Line Chart shows the data in a solid, connected line and the Scatter Chart shows it in separate, individual points or dots that look like an unconnected line.</p>
 
<p>As you can see there are many choices for charts. Choosing the best chart depends first on what you want the chart to show and next on how you want it to look. For example, since a Bar Chart and a Column Chart show data in a pretty similar way, choosing between them is more a choice about style than about use.</p>

<p>There are more charts than just the ones shown here. Explore the different types of charts and practice creating them. This helps you learn what the data looks like when displayed in different types of charts. In the practical exercises you will be asked to create a chart in a spreadsheet.</p>
