<h3>Section Review</h3>
								<hr>
		

<p class="lead">The Internet section explored concepts relating to <strong>communicating</strong> with the world on the vast Internet network. </p> 




																		
								<p>This section has familiarized you with addresses and protocols that are used to transmit digital information through networks. You have learned that in most cases Internet access and service is not free and that you will need to contract an Internet Service Provider to be able to connect to the Internet.</p>
								<p>You have learned about a variety of <strong>search engines</strong> as well as techniques for finding information on the Internet.</p>
								<p>Becoming aware that not all information on the Internet can be trusted should make you aware of and lead you to practice techniques for <strong>evaluating information</strong> found on the Internet.
								<p>You have learned about email basics and simple email etiquette.</p>

						<div class="twelve columns">


<p><strong>Key Concepts include the following:</p></strong>
							<ul class="disc">
								<li>It is important to know the file extension before double clicking on a file attachment. Be wary of files that are sent to you through email and have a file extension of .exe or .zip to protect your computer from destructive forces.</li>	
							<li>Each search engine contains a database of sites and when you search with the engine, you are searching the database, not the entire Internet. The sponsored sites (sites that have paid a fee) display first or in a priority position.</li>	
							<li>You must have and maintain both anti-virus software and a firewall on your computer if you connect to the Internet for protection against destructive forces.</li>
							<li>There are file formats such as PDF and XPS that are easy to share and print but hard to modify that were created to facilitate file sharing on the Internet.</li>
	
</ul>
