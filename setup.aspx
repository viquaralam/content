<p class="lead">Before you begin, you need to download the work files that are used in both the practice exercises and the practical tasks. </p>




  

<p>The DIDL Jumpstart materials refer to these files as the files located on the <strong>Testing USB Drive</strong>, however you have the option of putting these files on a USB device, a CD, or on the hard drive of your computer. </p>

<p>When you click on the green <strong>Download</strong> button below, you will be accessing a program that will "unpack" the work files and put them in the place you specify. Depending on the security you have on your computer, you may get some messages that warn you about running a program like this from the Internet. Do not worry, this program will not harm your computer. Answer the questions that will allow you to <strong>"Run"</strong> this program anyway.</p> 

<p>If you are unfamiliar with downloading programs to your computer, you can go through the <strong>Computer Basics Section</strong> first before you download the work files. Then you can come back here when have learned more drive letters and how to "Browse" to a particular storage device. You will not need the work files until you get to the <strong>File Managment Practice Exercises</strong> or until you wish to take a <strong>Certification Task.</strong></p>


<p>The only thing you need to know how to do to proceed now is how to choose where you want to store the files. The following pictures walk you through the whole process.</p> 

<p>You will not hurt anything by trying this process on your computer!</p>

<p>For convenience, we recommend you put your files on a USB Flash Drive like the one below. Any type or size will work.

<p>Insert the USB Flash Drive into a port on your computer. Below is a picture that shows what a port looks like (circled in the picture) and next to it there is a USB drive inserted.</p>

<hr>
<p>Once you insert the USB into the port, a screen will popup and you can see the drive letter.</p>

<p>Once you find out the drive letter, close this window by clicking on the X in the upper right corner of the window, but leave the USB in the port.</p>


<hr>
<p>Click on the green <strong> Download </strong> button below to begin the download process. Before you click on it, review the list of steps (below the button) to familiarize you with what will happen when you click on the <strong>Download</strong> button. Also, below the list you will find a slideshow of pictures for the download process that just keeps playing. Look at the list of steps and then view the slideshow a couple of times to familiarize yourself with the process. Your computer screens will probably look different from the ones shown, but you will get the general idea. </p>
