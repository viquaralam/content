<h3>Section Review</h3>
								<hr>
								<p class="lead">In the Word Processing section, you have learned about defaults and options in a program.</p>
								<p>You have learned how to control many of the settings within a program. It is important to understand that many of the controls to which you have been introduced are commonly available in most programs. An empowered user understands these skills and knows to look for these kinds of controls when working with a new program.</p>
								<strong>Below are some of the commonalities:</strong>
	
<br>
<br>

<ul class="disc">
							<li>Programs have program options that contain defaults and those can be changed.</li>
								<li>Help is organized similarly in programs.</li>
								<li>There are viewing options in most programs that allow you to view the information in different ways, including a Print Preview.</li>
								<li>Toolbars can be customized in most programs.
</li>								<li>Many programs have margins, headers, footers and a zoom feature and allow you to print in either portrait or landscape orientation.</li>
								<li>The print options are the same for most programs and you can print selected pages.</li>
								<li><strong>Copy (CTRL C)</strong>, <strong>cut (CRTL X)</strong>, and <strong>paste (CTRL V)</strong> utilize the clipboard in the same manner in most programs.</li>
								<li><strong>Undo (CTRL Z)</strong> works in most programs.</li>
								<li>Many times, newer versions of a program are not downward compatible, so a document created in the latest version of a program may not be able to be read by an older version of that same program.</li>
								<li>You can use Save As in most programs to select both the location of the file and the format of the file (file extension).</li>
								<li>In addition to the program controls, you learned about some automatic features you can employ and control to make your tasks easier such as: spelling and grammar Check, a date function that automatically updates, and a page numbering function.</li>
