<h3>Final Review</h4>
								<hr>
								<p class="lead">Empowerment is the ability to act with self-confidence and self-assurance.</p>



<p>By working through JumpStart, you are empowered to work with the software and programs most commonly found in the workplace and schools. You understand the fundamental purpose, organization and functions of these computer programs. Because of this, when you come across a newer version of the software or a different program, you can be confident and assured that you can understand and use it. You are an empowered user of technology.</p>


<p>There are common skills that are used across many software applications programs. It is important to reflect now on those skills and remember these options are <strong>commonly a part of most programs</strong>. Empowered users know "how things work" on a computer. Review the following to make sure you have made these connections. Most of the information provided here is review, however there are a few new shortcuts offered. </p>


<ul class="disc">
								<li><strong>Using Help:</strong> Most software programs provide Online Help. It is extremely important for you to become familiar with how to use this feature. Knowing how to find answers to your questions means the difference between an empowered user and a frustrated user. Most programs offer Help in several formats. Generally you can access the information in Help in two formats:  </li>

<ol>
<li><strong>Index</strong> is an alphabetical listing of keywords or topics with a selection box.</li>
<li><strong>Search/Find</strong> lets you search for a word or phrase within the Help topics or type in questions.</li>
</ol>

<p>Although Help menu items are organized differently in each program, generally, one or more of the above formats can be found. The key to using Help is deciding which keyword to use. </p></li>




<li><p><strong>Using the Clipboard:</strong> Windows has a hold area in which to place information for use between different software programs. For example, you can copy something to the clipboard from a word processing program, and then paste it into a spreadsheet program. Any <strong>copy command (CTRL C)</strong> or <strong>cut command (CTRL X)</strong> places information on the clipboard and a <strong>paste command (CTRL V)</strong> copies what was on the clipboard into the current program at the cursor location.</p>

<p>Typically, you can copy only one thing at a time to the clipboard. A successive copy command replaces what was there with the new information. Pictures or text can be placed on the clipboard as well. In the newer Microsoft Office Products, there is a clipboard task pane in which you can keep track of multiple objects on the clipboard. This task pane may automatically pop up when copying, cutting, or pasting.</p>

</li>






<li><strong>Printing the Screen:</strong> There is a way to print anything on the computer screen that utilizes the clipboard and any word processing program. The first step is to get a copy of the screen on the clipboard. There is a special key on the keyboard called the PRINT SCREEN Key. It is usually located on the top row of the keyboard next to the F12 key. When pressed, it places a copy of the screen on the clipboard. The second step is to print out the contents of the clipboard. This can be done easily in any word processing program. Simply start the word processing program, utilize the paste command, which pastes the contents of the clipboard into the document, and then print the document.</li>
								



<li><strong>Viewing Options</strong> Most programs allow you to see information in multiple formats. For example, in word processing programs, you can see just the document (as entered without margins), an outline format, or the way it will print with margins. You can view the headers and footers that print automatically and you can see the hidden formatting characters. Many programs allow you to open multiple documents at the same time. You can switch back and forth to the different documents by selecting different "windows" and you can even divide the screen into panes to view several documents on the same screen. </li>




					<li><strong>Print Preview:</strong> Most programs allow you to view the information exactly the way that it will print before you print it. This is in addition to the other viewing options.</li>





			<li><strong>Hiding/Displaying Toolbars:</strong> Toolbars are collections of related commands represented with icons that are displayed on the screen for ready access. By clicking on a tool, you activate that command without having to locate the command through the pull-down menus. Most commands are accessible both through the pull-down menus as well as on a toolbar. Because programs offer many commands, only the "most used" commands are shown on the screen as a default. You can hide/show toolbars or customize your toolbars. Toolbars can be time savers and the proficient user will be familiar with the use of toolbars.</li>



<li><strong>Undo:</strong> Many programs offer an option that allows you to undo an action you have initiated. This is extremely useful for the proficient user. If you have really made a mess, remember that you can always revert to the last saved version of your information. Just exit your mess and when asked if you want to save the changes, answer no. The keyboard shortcut for undo is <strong>CTRL Z</strong>.</li>



						<li><strong>Save As:</strong> Computer storage is like many large filing cabinets filled with many folders. All programs assume a default filing cabinet and folder to save your information if you do not specify one the first time you save. It is important to utilize the "Save As" option the first time so that you can specify where you want your information to be saved. Otherwise, you will not be able to find it when you try to retrieve the information. Subsequent saves will save to this specified location. Also, many programs allow you to convert your document to a different format utilizing Save As. </li>

					<li><strong>Working Within a Program:</strong> </li>


<ol>
<li><Strong>Selecting:</strong> Selecting means highlighting specific information. Generally, you select specific information by clicking on it or clicking and dragging over the information. This will cause the information to be highlighted. You deselect by clicking somewhere outside the highlighted information. To select a range of items, click on the first item then hold down the <strong>Shift Key</strong> while selecting second item. Holding down the Shift Key allows you to select all items in between the two selections. Holding down the <strong>CTRL Key</strong> while selecting allows you to select two nonadjacent items.</li>

<li><strong>Cutting/Copying and Pasting:</strong> Most programs allow you to cut/copy and paste. The cut/copy places the selected information on the clipboard and the paste places that copy where the cursor is located, but it does not erase it from the clipboard, therefore you can paste multiple times. Only another cut/copy command replaces what is on the clipboard. The keyboard shortcut for copy is <strong>CTRL C</strong> (while holding down the "Control" key, tap the "C" key). The keyboard shortcut for paste is <strong>CTRL V</strong> (while holding down the "Control" key, tap the "V" key).</li>

<li><strong>Find and Replace:</strong> Many programs allow you to find a word, number or character and replace it with another word, number or character.</li>

<li><strong>Zooming:</strong> In many programs you can "zoom" in for a close-up view of your information or zoom out to see more of the information at one time.</li>
</ol>

<li><strong>Page Setup and Formatting:</strong> Most programs allow you to set exactly how you want your information to look.</li>
<ol>
<li><strong>Margins:</strong> Most programs that allow you to print the information will allow you to set the print margins. You typically have top, bottom, left, and right margins.</li>

<li><strong>Headers and Footers:</strong> Many programs allow you to put information that you want to print on every page in a header and/or footer. You have to sometimes make changes in the margins to make sure the header and footer do not get in the way of the top and bottom settings for the margins.</li>

<li><strong>Page Orientation:</strong> Most programs allow you to print the document in either portrait (up and down the page) or landscape (across the page) orientation.</li>
</ol>

<li><strong>Fine Tuning:</strong> Many programs have tools available to help you customize your information.</li>

<ol>
<li><strong>Spelling:</strong> Many programs offer automatic spell check in which misspelled or misused words are automatically underlined. This feature can be turned on and off. Most programs allow you to check your spelling on command as well.</li>

<li><strong>Printing Selected Pages:</strong> It is always possible to choose a range of pages to print instead of printing the whole document. A useful shortcut to know for printing is <strong>CTRL P</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Fit to One Page:</strong> Some programs (example: Spreadsheet) provide a print option that automatically shrinks your text to fit all on one page. Therefore you could select this option instead of changing the margins and formatting the text to fit all on one page.</li>
</ol>
