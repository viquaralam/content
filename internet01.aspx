								<a name="content"></a><p class="lead"><strong>To begin, let's first talk about what the Internet is and what it is not.People often use the word Internet and the phrase World Wide Web like they mean the same thing, but they do not.</strong></p class="lead">
								<p><h4>What is the Internet?</h4></p>
								<p>The Internet is a global <strong>network</strong> that links computers from all over the world together. A network is a system used to link two or more computers. The Internet computer network is linked together with software and protocols. Recall, that you learned about software in Computer Basics, but what are protocols?</p>
								<p>The word <strong>protocol</strong> means a system of rules for how something is done. For computers, protocol means the ways, the format, and the rules that set how computers and computing devices communicate or exchange data with each other on the network.</p>
								<p>The <strong>World Wide Web</strong> (often called the Web) is accessed through the Internet. The Web is a part of the Internet; a big part for sure, but a part. There is almost limitless information about almost limitless topics on the Web that you can access and find using the Internet. You will learn more about Web later in this section.</p>
                                <p>The <strong>Cloud</strong> is a metaphor for the Internet and <strong>cloud computing</strong> refers to software and services that run on the Internet instead of your computer. As you learned in <i>Computer Basics</i>, you can store data on the cloud in <strong>cloud storage</strong> which allows you to access it through muliple devices with internet access such as desktop and laptop computers, along with tablets and smart phones.</p>

								<p><h4>The History of the Internet</h4></p>
								<p>The Internet is a now a very common and widely used way for people to find and share information, goods and services. But how did it come to be?</p>
								<p>It was created when the United States government wanted a communications network that could work even if part of it was destroyed. In 1969, ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency NETwork) was started. The first users of the ARPANET were mainly in the government and universities.</p>
								<p>ARPANET was different from other communication networks like the telephone, because it had no main control center. To make it even better, a single message was able to be sent over this network in pieces that could travel independently, by any number of different paths, through all kinds of computers.</p>
								<p>Over time, ARPANET became the Internet. As you learned earlier in this section, the Internet is a vast, global network of computers. This network is linked together using the same protocol, Internet Protocol (IP) for sending information.</p>
								<p>In the beginning, the government and university users communicated only in text format. Text format is data that is words only, no pictures, graphics, audio (sounds) or video. In the early 1990's a graphical interface (browser) was developed and what we know as the World Wide Web (WWW or Web) was born.</p>
								<p>It is through the Internet that users access email, instant messaging, video chat, and Internet telephone such as Skype, <a href="http://skype.com">http://skype.com</a>.</p>

								<p><h4>Types of Networks</h4></p>
								<p>So, as we already learned, a network is a system used to link two or more computers. There are also different kinds of networks of computers for different needs and purposes. Let's learn about the common kinds of networks.</p>
								<p>A <strong>Local Area Network (LAN)</strong> is a network in which the computers that are connected are close to each other. It is common to find a LAN in office buildings, schools, libraries and places like that. For example, in the workplace or in a library, many individual computers can connect to a common printer by using a LAN.</p>
								<p>An <strong>intranet</strong> is a self-contained network of computers within an organization that utilizes the same software and protocols as the Internet. You can think of intranet as similar to a phone system in an office building that has lots of individual phone line extensions in it connected to each other. The internal phone system is like a mini version of the larger phone system all of us use. And an intranet is a mini version of the larger Internet system that may or may not be connected to the Internet.</p>
								<p>A <strong>Wide Area Network (WAN)</strong> is a network that extends over a long distance. The Internet is a vast network that links computers from all over the world together with software and protocols. A system of LANs may also be linked together to form a WAN.</p>
								<p>A computer may access the Internet with a <strong>wired</strong> or a wireless connection. As you learned earlier, a wired connection uses a wire or cord that plugs into your computer with a jack slightly bigger than a modular phone jack. A <strong>wireless</strong> connection uses signals that are sent through radio waves.</p>
								<p>Most laptop computers are able to connect to the Internet using a wired or a wireless connection, depending upon the connection types that are available and your preference. Most desktops use a wired connection.</p>
								<p>In order for your computer to connect to a network, it must have some basic network hardware called a <strong>network adapter</strong>. The network adapter can either connect through a <strong>wire</strong> or through a <strong>wireless</strong>connection and is now a standard component of most desktop and laptop computers.</p>

								<p><h4>Web Browser and Search Engines</h4></p>
								<p>The most common software used on the Internet is a Web browser, usually just called a browser.</p>
								<p>A browser is a software program that allows the computer to access to the Web and allows the user to look through or "browse"ù information on Web sites and Web pages.</p>
								<p><strong>Popular browsers are Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Safari, among others.</strong></p>

<hr>
																								<p>Search engines are also commonly used software programs. A search engine finds information on the Web when the user enters words or phrases into it.</p>
								<p><h4>Commonly used search engines are:</h4></p>
