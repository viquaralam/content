<h3>Section Review</h3>
								<hr>
								<p class="lead">The Files and Folders section has introduced you to many housekeeping terms. You have also learned how information is organized on the storage devices and you should be able to take control over that organization.</p> 
								<p>You should know where your information is located at all times and you should be able to purposefully choose the device and the location of the folders and files when you create information. You should also be aware of the type of file you are working with through the file extension.</p>
								<p><strong>Key Concepts include the following:</p></strong>
								
								<ul class="disc">
								<li>File Management includes creating, organizing, deleting and managing files and folders.</li>
								<li>Online Help is available for File Management in several formats.</li> 
								<li>You have learned how to print out screenshots from the clipboard to prove that you have completed a task or to capture error messages that appear on the screen for future reference.</li>
								<li>There are a variety of views you can choose when viewing information on storage directories.</li>
								<li>It is important to know how to show the file extension of a file because the default is often to hide the file extension.</li>
								<li>Holding down the <b>Shift</b> Key while selecting allows you to select multiple consecutive files.</li>
								<li>Holding down the<b>Ctrl</b> Key while selecting allows you to select non-consecutive files.</li>
								<li><b>CTRL C</b>, <b>CTRL V</b>, and <b>CTRL X</b> are valuable keyboard shortcuts to memorize. These shortcuts can be used in many software programs such as <i>Microsoft Word</i> as well.</li>
							</ul>
