							<h4>Booting Up</h4>
							<p><strong>Booting up</strong>  most simply means to start up your computer. To the computer <strong> user,</strong>  (a user is any person using a computer for work, study, fun or any reason) <strong>booting up</strong> is a pretty simple task; to your computer, however, it is a much more complex task. There is actually a start up program that guides the computer each time it is powered on and makes sure that a list of programs are loaded and the computer is made ready for use until it is powered down or turned off. You will learn a more complete definition of <strong>booting up</strong> in the section about <strong>Computer Memory.</strong> </p>
							<hr>
                            <h4>User Interface</h4>
                            <p>The program that you encounter after the computer boots up is called the <strong>user interface</strong>. It provides a set of commands or menus through which you can interact with the computer to accomplish a task. Historically, computer users have typed commands or made selections from menus with a keyboard and/or a mouse. However, because touch screens are becoming more popular as a way to operate handheld and mobile devices, computers are providing touch screens as well. The user interface must be programmed to accept input from a touch screen.</p>
                            <p>Microsoft Windows is an example of a user interface, and there have been many different versions of Microsoft Windows created over the years. You will learn about the different versions in the section, <strong>Version of Windows and Microsoft Office</strong>.  In most versions of Windows, the first screen you see after the computer boots up is a desktop. You will learn more about the parts of the desktop in the section, <strong>Windows on Your Desktop</strong>. However, it is important to understand the controversy with Windows 8, which introduced major changes to the traditional computer user interface to look more like the user interface experienced by handheld devices such as tablet computers and smart phones.</p>
                            <p>On most handheld devices, the touch screen is utilized. Also, online stores are available on those devices for downloading and purchasing new software or apps (short for applications). Many online services are provided as well. These online services allow the user to sync (synchronize or coordinate) settings, dynamically (automatically) update apps, and share or store information, especially to the cloud or SkyDrive. You will learn more about the cloud and SkyDrives in the section on <strong>Data Storage on the Computer</strong>.</p>
                            <p>So Windows 8 replaced the familiar desktop as the first screen and provided a tiled screen, called the Metro view to compete with user interfaces on touch-friendly, handheld devices. This caused major problems for the user who operated a standard, non-touchscreen computer with a mouse. The familiar Start Button through which all programs were found in previous versions of Windows was replaced by an App list and “Charms” that appear and disappear on the right hand side of the screen. </p>
                            <p>In Windows 8 with a touch screen, you could swipe or scroll the screen up, down, right, or left just like you could on a smart phone or tablet computer. In other words, you interacted with the computer just like you interacted with your smart phone. Although you could still use a mouse with Windows 8, it worked better with a touch screen. Even though you could get back to the familiar desktop by selecting the desktop tile, users were still extremely dissatisfied with the changes in Windows 8. So Microsoft quickly released Windows 8.1 which restored a revised Start Button. However, it did not provide what the traditional Start Button provided. Because Windows 8 versions were not received well, Microsoft plans to go back to the desktop and Start Button for traditional computer users in successive versions.</p>
                            <p>Both the traditional desktop and the Metro view define how the user interfaces or works with the computer. Below is the traditional desktop in Windows.</p>

                          <p>  Below is the Metro view for Windows 8. Remember that you can choose the desktop from a tile in any version of Windows 8.<br /></p><hr />

                            Let’s explore what is meant by <strong>desktop </strong>when talking about the computer. We will also practice using your mouse.</span>

							<h4>Desktop and Icons</h4>
							
    
							<p> Think about what a desk is; it is a place where you work. People keep things that they use a lot on top of the desk, so they can get them quickly without having to look for them. They save and organize their documents in files and binders and put them in the desk drawers. They safely store all sorts of books, records or anything they want to keep in their desk.</p>	
							<p>The <strong>desktop</strong> on your computer works in much the same way. On the desktop you will see small pictures or symbols, called <strong>icons.</strong> <strong>Icons</strong> are quick ways (or short cuts) to get to the Internet, programs, games or other data stored in the computer. There are other ways to open programs and we will talk about those later. Double clicking with your mouse on an icon opens up a window for whatever it is that the icon represents.</p>
                            <p>Below is an example of a desktop and icons.</p>

								<br />
								<ul>
									<li>The desktop <strong>icon</strong> for the Internet looks different for each Web browser. A <strong>Web browser</strong> is the application (more on applications later) that allows your computer to access the Internet. By double clicking with your mouse on the <strong>Web browser icon</strong>, you can access the Internet. The above icons are Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and Google Chrome, which are common Web browsers.</li>
									<li>These are not the only icons you may see! Depending on the computer you use as well as the programs on it, there may be lots of icons on the desktop or only a few.</li>
								</ul>	
							<p>
                                If you do not see the icons on the desktop, don’t panic! In most versions of Windows, you can right click with your mouse anywhere on the desktop and select <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Personalize</b>. From the window provided, select the <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Change Desktop Icons</b> option. Select that option and a window such as the one below will allow you to put a checkmark by the desktop icons you wish to have on your desktop. Click on <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">OK</b> after you make your choice.</span></p>

For the sake of simplicity in this curriculum, we will assume the taskbar is located at the bottom of the screen. </p>
                            <p>The taskbar has three sections:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>In the far left bottom corner is the  <strong>Start Button.</strong> This is the section where, in many versions of Windows, you can find all of the programs on your computer;</li>
								<li>In the middle of the taskbar you will see the windows or tasks you have open on your computer;</li>
								<li>In the far right bottom section is the <strong>notification section</strong> which usually shows a clock, the volume, date, and other icons that give you information about the programs running on your computer.</li>

							<h4>Computer Mouse</h4>
							<br />
							<br />
							<p>A <strong>mouse</strong> is one of the most basic ways for you to do things on your computer. It may be connected to your computer with a wire or it may be wireless.</p>	
							<p>The action of the mouse is seen on the screen as a <strong>pointer.</strong> The pointer is often an arrow (it may also look like a hand) indicating the current location of the mouse on the screen. As you move the mouse (also called mouse pointer), you will see the pointer move on the screen.</p>	
							<p>When you are working with text, the mouse pointer may look different and is called a <strong>cursor,</strong> which looks a little like an upper case letter <strong>"I".</strong></p>	
							<p>This can seem a bit confusing at first, but the <strong>arrow, pointer, mouse pointer and cursor</strong> do pretty much the same things - as you move the computer mouse with your hand, the mouse pointer shows on the screen where you are.</p>
							<img class="img-wrap style1" src="images/computerbasics/cursors.jpg" alt="">
							<br />
							<br />
							<p>To make the best use of your mouse, place it to the side of your computer on a smooth, clean surface such as a mouse pad, rest your hand on top of the mouse and aim it away from you. When you reach the edge of the mouse pad, you can pick up the mouse and change the placement of it in order to keep using it.</p>

							<h4>Mouse Buttons</h4>
							<br />
							<br />
							<img class="center" src="images/computerbasics/mouse.png" alt="">
							<br />
							<p>Most computer mice have two buttons. The <strong>main or primary button is on the left</strong>  and a <strong> secondary button is on the right.</strong>  These two buttons have different functions. When you are told to <strong>click,</strong>  it means you press and release the primary (left) button only.</p>
							<p>To <strong> right click,</strong>  you press only right button on the mouse.</p>
							<p>Advanced mice may have more buttons with other functions such as a <strong>scroll wheel</strong>  between the buttons which helps you to <strong> scroll or browse</strong>  forward or backward quickly through information in an open window. Roll the wheel toward you to advance forward and away from you to go backwards.</p>
							<p>Sometimes you will click once with the left button and sometimes you need to <strong> double click.</strong>  Double clicking means you click twice on the left button of the mouse quickly. This takes practice. If single clicking does not get you the intended results, try double clicking.</p>
							<p><strong>Click and drag</strong>  means to left click and while holding down the button, drag the mouse.</p>
							<p>To <strong>hover</strong> with your mouse means to hold your mouse pointer over an item on the screen. Sometimes when you hover over an item or icon, a description or explanation of it will pop-up to tell you what that item or icon means.</p>
