<h4>Email Account</h4>


<p>An email account and address are unique to the individual user.</p>								<p>Many people have an email account where they work or go to school. Many people also have a personal email account that is separate from a work or school email.</p>
								<p>Regardless of the kind of email account, all email addresses, like Web addresses, are made up of common components or parts.</p>
								<p>All email addresses have three main parts:</p>
								<p><strong>username@domainname.suffix</strong></p>
								<ol>
									<li><strong>user name</strong></li>
									<li><strong>the symbol "@"</strong></li>
									<li><strong>domain name and suffix</strong></li>
								</ol>
								<p>The <strong>user name</strong> for your email account may be one you choose, especially if it is a personal email. It is very common for people to have personal email addresses through Google, Yahoo!, Hotmail and other companies like that.</p>
								<p>For personal email accounts, people can choose anything they want for a user name, as long as it is still available. People can have a user name that has letters and numbers in it and often use their name, a nickname, or some other word, phrase or combination to create a unique user name.</p>
								<p>If you have email at work or school, user names often have particular formats or rules and your user name may be given or assigned to you.</p>
								<p>After the user name, you will see a symbol, <strong>@</strong>. This symbol separates the user name from the domain name.</p>
								<p>The <strong>domain name</strong> may be long or short and may have more than one part. It will end with a domain suffix such as .com or .org or .edu or some other suffix.</p>
								<p>Many email addresses are very specific and case sensitive. This means, if an email address has capital letters in it, it is best to make sure you use them and make sure to include and symbols you see as well.</p>

							<h4>Email Basics</h4>
							<p>Email is now a very common way for people to communicate and send messages at work, school, or for personal reasons. Wherever you use email, there are some things to keep in mind.</p>	
							<p><strong>Need an Email Account?</strong> If you do not have an email account, you can get one, free of charge, with Google (Gmail), Yahoo!, Hotmail or other companies. If you go to the home page for Google, Yahoo or Hotmail, there will be links that you can click on in order to set up a free email account.</p>
							<p>If you have an ISP at home, like Comcast, you may also be able to get an email account with them.</p>

							<h4>Email Etiquette</h4>
							<p>Just like when you write a letter or a thank you note, there are certain rules to follow for keeping your email messages polite and friendly. Let's review some of them:</p>
						</div>
						<br />
					<div class="row">
						<div class="row display">
							<div class="three columns">
								<strong>Privacy</strong></strong>		
							</div>
								<div class="nine columns">
									Email is not private. Once you send an email, it can be sent or forwarded to lots of other people without you knowing about it.				
								</div>
							</div>
						<br />
						<div class="row display">
							<div class="three columns">
								<strong>Email Chains</strong></strong>		
							</div>
							<div class="nine columns">
								These are messages that often promise something good will happen if you forward it on to your friends. It may also promise something bad will happen if you do not. These are really just jokes or pranks and may even have viruses, malware or worms that can damage your computer. More on these later in the lesson.				
							</div>
						</div>
						<br />
							<div class="row display">
								<div class="three columns">
									<strong>Attachments</strong></strong>		
								</div>
							<div class="nine columns">
								Email messages may have attachments. Attachments may be documents, pictures, videos, links or some other form. Be very careful about attachments, since they may even have viruses, malware or worms that can damage your computer. Look at the file extension of the attachment before you double click on it. Make sure you do not double click those with .exe, .com, or .dat, to name a few because they will automatically start executing. It is a common way for viruses, malware, and worms to be released on your computer.				
							</div>
						</div>	
						<br />
						<div class="row display">
							<div class="three columns">
								<strong>Spam</strong></strong>		
							</div>
							<div class="nine columns">
								Spam is like junk mail that you get in your mail box at home. Most email accounts have a folder where Spam automatically is placed. Be very careful with Spam or anything that looks like Spam. It can have viruses, malware or worms that can damage your computer. You can also choose to send certain messages to the Spam folder. Your email program can help you to do that. Sometimes messages get sent to Spam that should not. It is a good idea to check your Spam folder every so often. But be very careful about opening anything in it!				
							</div>
						</div>
						<br />
						<div class="row display">
							<div class="three columns">
								<strong>Hacked</strong></strong>		
							</div>
							<div class="nine columns">
								When someone gets into your email account. This can be one of the results of viruses, mal ware or worms. It can also be an individual breaking into your email account.				
							</div>
						</div>						
						<br />
						<div class="row display">
							<div class="three columns">
								<strong>Flame</strong></strong>		
							</div>
							<div class="nine columns">
								Verbal attack through email. Email is not the best place to argue or fight. And remember, since email is not truly private, someone may forward your email on.				
							</div>
						</div>
						<br />
						<div class="row display">
							<div class="three columns">
								<strong>Shout</strong></strong>		
							</div>
							<div class="nine columns">
								WHEN YOU USE ALL CAPITALS in your email message, it is like shouting or yelling at someone. Capital letters can also be used to stress or emphasize your point. Use capitals carefully in your email messages.
