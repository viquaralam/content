								<p>Whether you are at home or at work, you will need a contract with an <strong>Internet Service Provider (ISP)</strong> to be able to connect to the Internet. Just like your phone or cable TV, in most cases, Internet access and service is not free. A major exception to this is at some public places, like libraries, hotels and coffee shops, where free, public Internet access may be offered to patrons or customers.</p>
								<p>An ISP has the hardware and software that provides a computer with an access point or <strong>point-of-presence (POP)</strong> on the Internet. (POP also stands for <strong>Post Office Protocol</strong> which is the standard protocol for receiving email.)</p>
								<p>The ISP that you use has a unique <strong>IP address</strong> and so does each computer or computing device. IP stands for Internet Protocol and an IP address is made up of numbers that identify and locate your computer on the Internet. An example of a numeric IP address is: 22.231.113.64.</p>

						<div class="twelve columns">
							<h4>Domain</h4>
							<p>Along with the numeric address, every IP address has a name connected to it, called a <strong>domain name</strong>. The domain name identifies the Web site connected with the IP address. For example, in the Web address, <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">http://www.yahoo.com</a> the word "yahoo" is the domain name for the company Yahoo! and in the Web address, <a href="http://www.irs.gov">http://www.irs.gov</a> the letters "irs" make up the domain name for the Internal Revenue Service.</p>	
							<p>Notice as well that after the domain name is a period, called a "dot"ù and then three letters, called a suffix. Every domain name has a suffix and most are three letters, although some are shorter or longer.</p>	
							<strong>Common domain name suffixes</strong>
							<br />

										</tr>

								</table>
								<p>All domain names are registered on a <strong>domain name system (DNS)</strong>. The DNS acts like a telephone book to connect the names and numbers of all IP addresses.</p>

							<h4>Web Address and URL</h4>
							<p>The address of a Web page on the Web is called a <strong>URL</strong>. URL stands for Uniform or Universal Resource Locator.
							<strong>It is very common to see a Web address like this:</strong> <a href="http://www.google.dom">www.google.com</a>
 or 							<a href="http://google.com">google.com</a>
							<p>However, as you look at the address bar, you may see some other letters and symbols, such as
								<strong>http//:</strong> HTTP stands for <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</strong> and is a formatting protocol for formatting and sending data. Whether you see the http//: in a Web address or not depends upon a number of things, including your browser and it doesn't make a Web address right or wrong.</p>
							<p>Every Web site on the Web has its own unique URL and many Web sites have a lot of information or data on them. The main page of a Web site is called the <strong>Home Page</strong>. To hold and organize all of the data on a Web site, it may have multiple Web pages where this data can be viewed. Each Web page within a Web site has its own Web address as well.</p>
							<h4>The Parts of a URL such as http://empconcepts.com/testdrive.pdf</h4>


<ol>
<li><strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</strong> -  In this example, it is the letters and symbols at the beginning of the web address, http//:.</li>
							

<li><strong>Domain Name</strong> - In this example, the domain name is empconcepts.com.</li>

			<li><strong>Specific web page on website</strong> - In this example, the web page displayed is testdrive.pdf.</li>
</ol>
							<p>After the domain name is the full path to the specific Web page. In the example, the Web address of this specific page on the Web site is: http//:www.empconcepts.com/testdrive.pdf.</p>
							<p>A Web page may also have the file extension of htm or html. Another file extension for a Web page is .asp (active server page) or .aspx. This type of page pulls up very current data from a database at the time the user accesses it.</p>
							<p>There are many file extensions for Web pages and file extension means a particular type of file. In the example, notice that the extension of the specific Web page is pdf. This is because the document on this Web page is not formatted in HTML, but PDF. To properly view and read this document, the user must have Adobe Reader installed on the computer.</p>
