								<h4>Definition</h4>																		
								<p><strong>Computer memory</strong> holds onto the digital information (it may also be called data) that is stored in bytes, as you learned about in the previous section, but only while the computer is powered on. If the computer loses power or you shut it down, data held in memory is erased and any data you are working on is lost because all of the switches are turned off when the computer shut down and powered off.</p>
								<p> <strong>Computer memory is temporary and lasts only as long as the computer is powered on.</strong> When you power up the computer, there is no data held in memory from when it was last powered on. To save your data long term, it must be moved out of memory and into storage on a drive. You will learn about storage in the next section, so let's learn more about the two main types of computer memory.</p>
								<hr>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="twelve columns">
								<h4>ROM, RAM and Primary Storage</h4>	
								<p>There are different types of computer memory, and you will learn about two primary types that every computer, even the most basic one, has:</p>
								
								<ul class="circle">
									<li><strong>ROM</strong></li>
									<li><strong>RAM</strong></li>
								</ul>
								
								<ol>
									<li><strong>ROM</strong> is short for Read Only Memory. This is memory built into the computer with a function determined at the factory and it located on the motherboard. It is called read only because instructions and data can be read from this memory but they cannot be changed or overwritten. Unlike other memory, the instructions in ROM are not lost when the computer is turned off and ROM is used in computers and manyother electronic devices such as calculators, DVD players, and even cars.</li>
									<li><strong>RAM</strong> is short for Random Access Memory. This is what is commonly referred to as computer memory and it is located on the motherboard. It is temporary memory and stores data and programs while the computer is powered up and on. <strong>RAM is also called primary storage</strong>. Information and data stored in RAM and primary storage is erased and lost when the computer is turned off.</li>
								</ol>
								
								<p>As you learned in the section on digital language, byte values are the units by which digital information and data are measured, so, the memory power, it's RAM, is measured in large byte values, often in GB. Why is this important to understand? It is important because a bigger byte value of RAM means your computer can handle and hold more digital information or data. It means the computer can do more tasks at the same time without slowing down or even stopping. An empowered computer user will want the most RAM that they can afford.</p>

								<h4>Secondary Storage</h4>
									<p>So, if information and data held in RAM or primary storage is temporary and lost when the computer is turned off, how and where can you save data so it is not lost? Your computer has a number of options for storage!</p>
									<p><strong>Secondary Storage</strong> is where you save programs, information and data more permanently on your computer. These computer drives act like electronic filing cabinets (with lots of file folders inside them) where you can store and organize data on the computer. Information and data can be read from drives and written on it; therefore, drives are called Read/Write rather than Read Only (ROM).</p>
									<p>After data has been saved and stored to a drive, the computer will recall the data for the user in the same way as it was last stored every time until the user makes a change to it. You can see that understanding data storage is important for you to learn.</p>
									<p>So, let's look at the types of drives that are commonly found on a computer.</p>

							<div class="twelve columns">
								<h5>Hard Drive</h5>							
								<p><strong>Hard Disk</strong> (also called the hard drive or the C: Drive) is a standard, permanent drive on the computer that is installed at the factory. The storage capacity of this drive is large and is usually measured in gigabytes.</p>
								<hr>
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="twelve columns">
								<h5>CD Drive</h5>							
								<p><strong>CD Drive</strong>, short for Compact Disc, can be a permanently installed drive or a portable drive depending upon your computer. A CD stores data in different formats, and is commonly for audio data, like music for example. CD-ROMs are read only and CD-RWs can be both read and written upon. Please note, on many newer computers, the drive for CDs and DVDs is combined and it looks like the pictures for the CD drive below:</p>

								<hr>
							</div>
						</div>
								

						<div class="row">
							<div class="twelve columns">
								<h5>DVD Drive</h5>								
									<p><strong>DVD Drive</strong> is short for Digital Versatile Disc or Digital Video Disc and can be a permanently installed drive or a portable drive depending upon your computer. There are a number of DVD formats. DVD-Video is the format designed for full-length movies. DVD-ROM is used by computers to store data. Please note, on many newer computers, the drive for CDs and DVDs is combined and it looks like the pictures for the CD drives above.</p>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="twelve columns">
								<h5>USB Drive</h5>								
								<p><strong>USB Drive</strong> (also called: <strong>Flash drive, keychain drive, jump drive, pen drive</strong>) is a portable, non-permanent data storage device that allows the user to attach it to any computer at a USB port. The computer's operating system recognizes the USB as a portable or removable drive. Attaching it to a computer does not require rebooting the computer, the device does not require batteries and is lightweight enough to attach to a keychain.</p>
							<img class="left space" src="images/computerbasics/USB.png"/>

						</div>



						<div class="row">
							<div class="twelve columns">
								<h5>USB Port</h5>
								<p>The <strong>USB port</strong> is located in different places, depending on your computer. The port is where you plug in or attach the device to your computer. Your computer may have two or more ports, since other devices, such as an iPod or a printer, may also plug in and attach to the computer in this way.</p>
								<p>For a desktop computer, the ports are often located in the tower that has the hard drive and CD and DVD drives. For a laptop, they are usually located in the base of the computer, on the side. But, wherever it is located, the port looks like the image below.</p>
								<img class="left space" src="images/computerbasics/usbport.png"/>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="twelve columns">
								<h5>Network Drive</h5>	
								<p><strong>Network Drive</strong> - Computers located in workplaces or other organizations with many users, may also have the secondary storage option of a network drive for storing data. A network drive is physically separate from the computer and may also be called a remote drive. It is usually shared by multiple users and has a large data storage capacity.</p>

								<h4>Using the USB</h4>
								<p>When you plug the USB Drive in the USB port, an AutoPlay menu pops up like the one below. It tells you the drive letter that is associated with the USP port (circled in the picture below.) In this example, the drive letter is F.</p>
								<img class="left space" src="images/computerbasics/Autoplay.jpg"/>
								<p>You can select <strong>Open folder to view files </strong> to see what is stored on the flash drive.</p>
								<p>Be sure to safely remove your USB drive when you are finished. To do this, there is a Safely Remove Hardware icon that pops up in the taskbar similar the one shown here. </p>
								<img class="left space" src="images/computerbasics/USBremoveicon.jpg"/>


								<p>You can slowly move the mouse over the task bar to locate this icon. A pop-up menu will appear to describe each icon as the mouse hovers over the option a pop-up menu or information box appears.</p>
								<p>When you finish with a USB storage device, <strong>ALWAYS</strong> click on this icon and select Safely Remove Hardware before you disconnect it. This will ensure the information you placed on the flash drive stays intact and is not damaged when you remove the drive. This icon disappears when you disconnect the flash drive.</p>

								<h4>RAM and the Operating System of Your Computer</h4>
								
								<p>Now that you are familiar with RAM, Primary Storage and Secondary Storage, let's learn a little bit more about how RAM functions, particularly when booting up your computer.</p>
								<p>Since the computer's RAM (Primary Storage) is erased when the computer is turned off, the operating system program must be loaded into RAM each time the computer is powered on, in order for it to function. This process of loading the operating system onto the RAM when the computer is powered on is the full definition of the term <strong>Booting Up the Computer</strong>.</p>


																
								<p>The instructions for Booting Up are stored in ROM. When you power up the computer, ROM takes control to load a copy of the operating system from the hard disk onto the RAM to be executed, which means to perform the tasks instructed by the program or file.</p>
								
								<p>After the operating system program is loaded into RAM, the instructions in the startup file are read and processed. Programs and procedures that are stored in the startup file are executed. Programs such as virus-protection programs typically begin executing at this time and continue to run in the background while you operate your computer. You can check your taskbar at the bottom of the screen to determine which programs have been started on your computer during startup.</p>
								
														
								<p>When you select a program from the Start Button or when you click on an icon on the desktop, a copy of that program is loaded into RAM and opened for you in a window on the screen.</p>
								<p>For example, if you select Microsoft Word, a copy of the program is loaded from the hard disk into RAM and then the program opens in a new window on the screen so that you can start using it. As you type the new document, it is held in RAM until you save it to a storage device.</p>
