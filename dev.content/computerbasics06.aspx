								<h4>Definition and Diagram</h4>																		
								<p>The keyboard, like the mouse, is one of the most basic ways for you to do things on your computer.</p>
								<p>A <strong>keyboard</strong> is made up of keys (or buttons) that have letters, numbers and symbols on them. They are used not only to type text or other information into the computer, but also to perform tasks or operations on the computer as well.</p>
								<p>Take a look at the diagram below; it shows how a keyboard is usually organized. However, your keyboard may look different.</p>
								<img class="img-wrap style1" src="images/computerbasics/keyboard.jpg"/>

<hr>								
								<p>As you can see, there are Control Keys, Function Keys, Alphanumeric Keys, Navigation Keys,and a Numeric Keypad. The alpha-numeric keys are used for typing text mostly, unless they are used in combination with some of the other keys, especially the control keys or function keys. You will learn more about using these keys later.</p>
								
								<p>Being able to use the keyboard quickly and effectively is a very basic and very important part of being an empowered user of computers and computer technology. The best way to get better using your keyboard is to learn more about the keyboard and to practice typing on it and using it.</p>
								
								<hr>
								
								<p>Here are some links to help you increase the speed and accuracy with which you type on the keyboard as well as learning about its other uses.</p>

								<h4>The Enter Key</h4>

							<p>The <strong>Enter Key</strong> is used for different purposes in different programs. In word processing, it is used to go the next line. In file management, it is used to indicate you have completed typing and want an answer from the computer.</p>

								<h4>Print Screen Key</h4>
								
								<p>There is one control key that you need to learn about because it performs an important action and you will use it a lot as you move through the DIDL Jump Start curriculum. That key is the <strong>Print Screen key</strong>.</p>
								<p>The Print Screen key is a control key on your keyboard that takes a <strong>picture or screenshot</strong> of what is on your computer screen when you push it. This action sends the screenshot to what is called the computer's <strong>clipboard</strong>, which is a holding area for any kind of data that you command the computer to copy.</p>
								<p>Now that the screenshot has been sent to the clipboard, in order to print it, you must place, or <strong>paste, the screenshot into a word processor</strong> so that you can print it or save it.</p>
								<p>To paste the screenshot, make sure you have a word processor like WordPad from Accessories or Word. Look for the cursor in the word processor, and then right click on the mouse and from the pop-up menu select paste.</p>
								
								<p>You should now see the screenshot in the word processor. You will learn more about using the clipboard, as well as copy and paste in Files and Folders.</p>
								
								<p>You will use Print Screen to show what you have done in a task or exercise. This key is also helpful to use if you ever see an error message on your computer screen because you can take a screenshot of the error message.</p>
								<p>Before you can use this Print Screen action, you must first locate the Print Screen key on your keyboard.</p>
								
								<hr>
								
								<h4>Location and Use of Print Screen Key</h4>
								<p>There are many different types of keyboards and the Print Screen key looks and operates a little differently on each one.</p>
								
								<p>As in the diagram below, your Print Screen key is a control key and probably located at or near the top right of the keyboard next to the function keys and the other control keys.</p>
								<p>Look carefully at your keyboard to locate the Print Screen key. Remember, the Print Screen key on your computer could look like any of the following examples below or yours could be different.</p>

 										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
									<img src="images/computerbasics/prtscvista.jpg"/>
									
							<br />
							<br />
 
								<p>If your Print Screen key looks like the two on the left in the above diagram, you will have to hold down the Shift Key to get Print Screen to work.</p>
								<p>Notice the box around prt sc in the third key. If your key looks like this, you will need to look for the Function Key.</p>


						<div><img class="left" src="images/computerbasics/fn.png"/></div>

								 <p>You will find the Function Key in the lower left bottom of the keyboard. It may have a box around it as well, which will let you know to hold the Function Key down at the same time that you press the Print Screen key to make it work.</p>
								<p>Depending upon your computer and keyboard, the Print Screen key may perform only that action or it may have other functions too. What your Print Screen key looks like will help you learn how to make it work.</p>

							<h5><em>Try It!</em></h5>
								<ul class="circle">
									<li>Open up Microsoft Word and then open a new document.</li>
									<li>Click on the My Computer or Computer icon to get a window on the screen.</li>
									<li>Hit your Print Screen key, then paste.</li>
									<li>If you did not get the screenshot, try the steps below.</li>
									<li>There is one other key that you might need to consider when getting your Print Screen key to work. It is an F Lock or Function Lock Key. You may need to press it ONCE to activate it. It is a toggle key like the Number Lock key. Click it once to turn it on and again to turn it off. On the keyboard in the diagram, there is a green light above the key that indicates the key is operational. However all keyboards that have the F Lock key do not have this light, which makes it difficult to know if it is activated or not.</li>
