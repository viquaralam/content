							<h3>Section Review </h3>
							<hr>
							
					
<p class="lead">  In the Spreadsheets section, you have learned about a program designed specifically to work with possibilities relating to numbers and calculations.     </p>


<p>You have learned that a spreadsheet is especially valuable for answering <strong>"What If?"ù </strong>questions because it allows you to change the numbers and immediately see the effects of those changes.</p>


<p>Entering information in a spreadsheet program is different from entering information in other programs because as you type, the spreadsheet automatically begins to make assumptions for you to save you time.</p> 

<p>The first character you type is a signal to the spreadsheet and as you type, you can see assumptions being made. To stay out of trouble, you <strong>MUST</strong> signal the spreadsheet that you are finished entering the information into a cell by hitting the Enter, tab, or arrow key. This "registers" the information into the cell.</p> 

<p>Spreadsheets offer a long list of automatic functions and calculations and the list is searchable. When you select a function, the spreadsheet makes assumptions about what you want to do to help you with that function.</p> 

<p>You have learned how to exercise control by either accepting the program defaults or customizing them with your own choices. You have also learned how to represent numbers that can change by using cell references in formulas.</p>

<p>You extended your control over the program by learning about the many printing options that create user-friendly hardcopies of spreadsheets.</p>


<p><strong>Other major concepts include the following:</strong></p>

<ul class="disc">

<li>Spreadsheets have sophisticated formats for numbers.</li>

<li>Charts make numbers more understandable by creating visual representations of numbers.</li>

<li>Different charts are used to depict different relationships.</li> 

<li>Functions and formulas will automatically calculate numeric data.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Common Skills Applied</strong></p>

<ul class="disc">

<li>Portrait or landscape printing orientation</li>

<li>Margins, headers, and footers </li>

<li>Printing selected pages</li> 

<li>Viewing options</li>
<li>Insert, delete, copy, cut, and paste</li>
<li><strong>CTRL Z, CTRL X, CTRL V, CTRL C</strong></li>

</ul>
