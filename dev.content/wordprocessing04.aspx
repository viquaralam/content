	<p class="lead"><strong>Word processing software and programs have many built in features that
    make the creation, typing, editing and formatting of your documents easier
    to do. However, to maximize what these tools and features can do for you,
    you must understand what they do and how to use them.</strong></p class="lead">

    <h4>Help</h4>

    <p>Just like in Windows, knowing how to find answers to your questions
    means the difference between an empowered user and a frustrated user. With
    each application or program you use on your computer, you must identify and
    become familiar with the Help feature.</p>

    <p>It is important to note that Microsoft Word Help is different from
    Windows Help. Tapping the F1 key brings up Help in Word just as it does in
    Windows. Look for the Help feature in your version of Word by tapping the
    <strong>F1</strong> Key, selecting Help on the Menu or following the symbol. Determine if
    you have Index or Contents and note the difference between Windows Help and
    Word Help.</p>

    <h4>Viewing Options</h4>

    <p>Most programs allow you to see information in multiple formats. In
    Windows you were able to select views such as Tiles, Icons, Details, etc.
    to view the files and folders on a storage device. Most word processors
    operate on the <strong>WYSIWYG</strong> (<strong>W</strong>hat <strong>Y</strong>ou             <strong>S</strong>ee <strong>I</strong>s <strong>W</strong>hat <strong>Y</strong>ou             <strong>G</strong>et) principle. This means
    that what you see on the computer screen looks very close to what you will
    see when you print.</p>

    <p>In word processing programs, there are many options for how you view the
    document. You can see just the document (as entered without margins), an
    outline format, or the way it will print with margins. You can view the
    headers and footers that print automatically and you can see the hidden
    formatting characters. Graphics may show up in one view but not in another
    view.</p>

    <p>Most programs allow you to view the information exactly the way that it
    will print before you print it. This is called <strong>Print Preview</strong> or Print
    Layout and is in addition to the other viewing options. If you cannot
    easily find Print Preview, access Help to learn how to get to Print Preview
    in your version of Word.</p>

    <p>In many programs you can <strong>"zoom"</strong> in for a close-up view of your
    information or zoom out to see more of the information at one time. This
    feature is not as important in a word processing program as it is in other
    programs because of the many views available in a word processor; however
    it can be useful at times. If you cannot easily find Print Preview, access
    Help to learn how to zoom in your version of Word.</p>

    <p>Most programs allow you to open more than one document at the same time.
    Each document usually opens in its own window. You can switch back and
    forth to the different documents by selecting different "windows". You can
    even divide the screen into panes to view several documents on the same
    screen. Select the View Menu option at the top of any open Word document
    and check out the viewing options in your version of Word.</p>

    <h4>Spelling &amp; Grammar Check</h4>

    <p>An important part of the document cycle is <strong>Spelling and Grammar Check</strong>.
    Word processors automatically correct or prompt the user to correct many
    common typing, spelling and grammatical errors. It is important to know how
    to use these features and to control the automatic or default settings.</p>

    <p>There are <strong>program options</strong> that contain the default settings for the
    program. See the Orientation to Office section for more details on program
    options). Most of the default settings are helpful, but explore the options
    for yourself to decide if you would like to change them.</p>

    <p>Explore the spelling and grammar defaults and notice how misspelled
    words are indicated. In addition to the methods outlined below, you can
    press <strong>F7</strong> to start the Spelling and Grammar Check.</p>

    <h4>Thesaurus</h4>

    <p>A thesaurus is usually available as well. A <strong>thesaurus</strong> gives the user
    synonyms (different words with the same meaning). Access Help for more
    information about this tool and to learn how to use it.</p>

    <p>You may also access the thesaurus by right clicking on the word you
    would like to change. From the menu that appears choose synonyms or
    thesaurus and synonym choices will appear in a drop-down box, as in the example below:</p>

    <h4>Cursors</h4>

    <p>There are two cursors you need to know about.</p>

    <ul class="disc">

    <li>I-beam cursor is so called because it looks a bit like an
    uppercase "I." It follows the roll of the mouse and becomes an arrow
    when positioned outside the page borders.</li>

    <li>Insertion point cursor (flashing cursor) looks like a line that
    flashes on and off and is positioned using the I-beam cursor and a click of
    the mouse button. This cursor indicates your location in the document. If
    you are scrolling around in the document and want to make an addition, be
    sure to point to the new location with the I-beam cursor. Then, click the
    mouse button to align both cursors.</li>

    <h4>Word Wrap</h4>

    <p><strong>Word wrap</strong> is a word processing feature that automatically moves any
    words that will not fit on the current line where you are typing to the
    next line along with the cursor.</p>

    <p>You can also wrap text around a picture or drawing object with a chosen
    style and this is called <strong>text wrapping</strong>. Text wrapping will be explored in
    the Graphics section.</p>

    <h4>Deleting</h4>

    <p>To <strong>delete</strong> a character (a character is a letter, number, symbol in a
    typed document) to the left or behind the insertion point, press the
    backspace key. To delete a character to the right or in front of the
    insertion point, press the delete key. Practice the two methods of deleting
    by typing in your name and deleting parts of it.</p>

    <div class="row">
    <div class="twelve columns">
    <h4>Enter key</h4>

    <p>When you press the <strong>enter key</strong> while typing a document, it places an
    unseen character into the document. This hidden character instructs the
    word processor to go to the next line to continue typing text. The most
    common reason for this is when the user finishes typing a section of text,
    most often a paragraph, and wants to start a new section or paragraph.</p>

    <p>You can delete this hidden character by using the backspace or delete
    keys, depending on where the insertion point is located.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="row">
    <div class="twelve columns">
    <h4>Types of Spaces in a Document</h4>

    <p>As explained above, when you press the enter key, a <strong>hidden character</strong> is
    placed in the document that tells the word processor to go to the next
    line.</p>

    <p>The <strong>space bar</strong> is a long key at the bottom of the key board. You press it
    after you finish typing a word. The space bar moves the cursor one space
    each time you press it.</p>

    <p>The <strong>tab key</strong> moves the cursor forward a set number of spaces. Tab key
    spacing usually has preset, default settings, but you can change the tab
    key settings to your needs.</p>

    <p>The <strong>arrow keys move the cursor</strong> over characters and text that are placed
    in of the typed document without putting space between the characters like
    the space bar and tab keys. You must enter either spaces, tabs, or the
    enter key to move to a desired location on a line. You cannot use the arrow
    keys to get there if there are no characters entered.</p>

    <p>Let's practice using these different spacing tools. First, open up the
    word processing program on your computer. Next, open up a blank
    document.</p>

    <p>Type a sentence in a document and hit Enter at the end of the sentence.
    Hit the tab key then type another sentence. Hit Enter again to go to the
    next line.</p>

    <p>Now use the arrow keys to move over the character you placed in the
    document.</p>

    <p>Type three or four more sentences and notice how the text wraps and
    automatically goes to the next line. Practice putting your cursor in
    different places in the sentence and in different places in the middle of
    words. Press the space bar, the tab key, the enter key and the backspace
    key to see how it changes the spacing and appearance of the text you have
    typed.</p>

   <h4>Hidden Characters</h4>

    <p>As explained above in the section about spacing, there are unseen or
    hidden characters in the documents you create using a word processor. When
    you press the letter "Q"ù on the keyboard and see a "Q"ù on the
    screen. When you press the <strong>space bar</strong>, <strong>enter key</strong> or         <strong>tab key</strong>, you are
    commanding the word processor to make space in the document. What you see
    on the screen then is blank space.</p>

    <p>You can view these hidden characters in a document by choosing the
    viewing option in Word that lets you do that. Try that for the document you
    have created above.</p>

    <p>To turn on the hidden characters, click on the <strong>Show/Hide (∂)</strong> tool on
    the toolbar at the top of an open Word document. You may also use the
    following instructions:</p>

    <p>Notice in your document there is a dot for every space (in some
    versions), an  	&rarr; for every tab, and a ∂ symbol placed every time you hit
    the Enter Key. You can use this to problem solve with documents in the
    future.</p>

    <p>You may turn this feature off by clicking again on the ∂ tool or
    un-checking the boxes you checked.</p>

    <h4>UNDO</h4>

    <p>You can <strong>undo</strong> the last thing you typed or did in your document by using
    the arrow that circles to the left at the top of an open Word document. The
    symbol looks something like this:</p>

    <img class="img-wrap style1" src="images/wordprocessing/undo.jpg"/>
    <br>

    <p>You may also undo the last thing you typed or did in your document by
    pressing <strong>CTRL + Z</strong>. This is another keyboard shortcut you will need to
    memorize.</p>

    <h4>Any Key</h4>

    <p>This may seem clear to most, but it can be confusing to some people.
    When your computer calls for you to press <strong>"any key,"</strong> that means to press
    any key on the keyboard. There is not a special key labeled "any key."</p>

    <h4>Number Lock Key</h4>

    <p>If you have a number keypad, notice the <strong>Number Lock key (Num Lock)</strong>
    located on the number keypad. It is just like the shift lock key. When it
    is on, you get numbers. When it is off, you get the alternate function
    indicated on the key. You turn this function on and off by pressing the Num
    Lock key. There is sometimes a light on the keyboard indicating when this
    function is turned on.</p>

    <h4>Caps Lock Key</h4>

    <p>Notice the <strong>Caps Lock key</strong> located on the keypad. When it is on, the text
    you type will all be upper case or capital letters. You turn this function
    on and off by pressing the Caps Lock key. There is sometimes a light on the
    keyboard indicating when this function is turned on.</p>
