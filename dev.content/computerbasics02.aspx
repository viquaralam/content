							<h4>Desktop and Icons</h4>
							<img class="center" src="images/computerbasics/mycomputerdesktop.png"/>
							<p>Your <strong>desktop</strong> is the first thing you see on the screen when you start your computer and it finishes powering up. Think about what a desk is; it is a place where you work. People keep things that they use a lot on top of the desk, so they can get them quickly without having to look for them. They save and organize their documents in files and binders and put them in the desk drawers. They safely store all sorts of books, records or anything they want to keep in their desk.</p>	
							<p>The desktop on your computer works in much the same way. On the desktop you will see small pictures or symbols, called <strong>icons.</strong> Icons are quick way (or short cut) to get to the Internet, programs, games or other data stored in the computer. There are other ways to open programs and we will talk about those later. Double clicking with your mouse on an icon opens up a window for whatever it is that the icon represents.</p>

								<p>The recycle bin is the computer's trash can. When you delete data (documents, programs etc.) this is where they go. You can double click on the recycle bin to see what is in it or to empty it. There will be more information on how to use the recycle bin later in the program.</p>

A <strong>Web browser</strong> is the application (more on applications later) that allows your computer to access the Internet. By double clicking with your mouse on the <strong>Web browser icon</strong>, you can access the Internet. The above icons are Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and Google Chrome, which are common Web browsers.</li>
									<li>These are not the only icons you may see! Depending on the computer you use as well as the programs on it, there may be lots of icons on the desktop or only a few.</li>

							<h4>Desktop Taskbar</h4>
							<br />
							<img class="center" src="images/computerbasics/desktoptaskbar.png"/>
							<p>At the bottom of the screen you will see a strip called the <strong>taskbar.</strong> The taskbar has three sections:</p>	
							<ol>
								<li>In the far left bottom corner is the <strong>Start Button.</strong> This is the section where you can find all of the programs on your computer;</li>
								<li>In the middle of the taskbar you will see the windows or tasks you have open on your computer;</li>
								<li>In the far right bottom section is the <strong>notification section</strong> which usually shows a clock, the volume, date, and other icons that give you information about the programs running on your computer.</li>

							<h4>Computer Mouse</h4>
							<br />
							<br />
							<p>A <strong>mouse</strong> is one of the most basic ways for you to do things on your computer. It may be connected to your computer with a wire or it may be wireless.</p>	
							<p>The action of the mouse is seen on the screen as a <strong>pointer.</strong> The pointer is often an arrow (it may also look like a hand) indicating the current location of the mouse on the screen. As you move the mouse (also called mouse pointer), you will see the pointer move on the screen.</p>	
							<p>When you are working with text, the mouse pointer may look different and is called a <strong>cursor,</strong> which looks a little like an upper case letter <strong>"I".</strong></p>	
							<p>This can seem a bit confusing at first, but the <strong>arrow, pointer, mouse pointer and cursor</strong> do pretty much the same things - as you move the computer mouse with your hand, the mouse pointer shows on the screen where you are.</p>
							<img img class="img-wrap style1" src="images/computerbasics/cursors.jpg"/>
							<br />
							<br />
							<p>To make the best use of your mouse, place it to the side of your computer on a smooth, clean surface such as a mouse pad, rest your hand on top of the mouse and aim it away from you. When you reach the edge of the mouse pad, you can pick up the mouse and change the placement of it in order to keep using it.</p>

						<div class="twelve columns">
							<h4>Mouse Buttons</h4>
							<br />
							<br />
							<img class="center" src="images/computerbasics/mouse.png"/>
							<br />
							<p>Most computer mice have two buttons. The <strong>main or primary button is on the left</strong>  and a <strong> secondary button is on the right.</strong>  These two buttons have different functions. When you are told to <strong>click,</strong>  it means you press and release the primary (left) button only.</p>
							<p>To <strong> right click,</strong>  you press only right button on the mouse.</p>
							<p>Advanced mice may have more buttons with other functions such as a <strong>scroll wheel</strong>  between the buttons which helps you to <strong> scroll or browse</strong>  forward or backward quickly through information in an open window. Roll the wheel toward you to advance forward and away from you to go backwards.</p>
							<p>Sometimes you will click once with the left button and sometimes you need to <strong> double click.</strong>  Double clicking means you click twice on the left button of the mouse quickly. This takes practice. If single clicking does not get you the intended results, try double clicking.</p>
							<p><strong>Click and drag</strong>  means to left click and while holding down the button, drag the mouse.</p>
							<p>To <strong>hover</strong> with your mouse means to hold your mouse pointer over an item on the screen. Sometimes when you hover over an item or icon, a description or explanation of it will pop-up to tell you what that item or icon means.</p>

							<h4>Booting Up</h4>
							<br />
							<br />
							<p><strong>Booting up</strong>  most simply means to start up your computer. To the computer <strong> user,</strong>  (a user is any person using a computer for work, study, fun or any reason) booting up is a pretty simple task; to your computer, however, it is a much more complex task. There is actually a start up program that guides the computer each time it is powered on and makes sure that a list of programs are loaded and the computer is made ready for use until it is powered down or turned off. You will learn a more complete definition of booting up in the section about <strong>Computer Memory.</strong> </p>
