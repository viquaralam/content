								<h4>Software Definition</h4>																		
								<p>Computers are machines. Just like you can control the climate in your house with air conditioning (which is a machine) by setting the temperature, you can control information by using a computer. It a machine that does what the programs installed on it instruct it to do or what the user (you) tell it to do. Some programs are installed at the factory where the computer is made (like the start up program we talked about in the booting up section) and some are installed afterwards (like games) because a user chooses to do so.</p>
								<p>The programs that instruct the computer to do a certain job are grouped together and called <strong>software</strong>. There are two major types of computer software:</p>
								<ol>
									<li><strong>System Software</strong></li>
									<li><strong>Applications Software</strong></li>
								</ol>
								
								<hr>
								
								<h4>System Software</h4>
								
								<p><strong>System software</strong> is a general term that refers to a group of programs that operate the computer hardware, store and process data, and provide a place or <strong>platform</strong> on which to run application software.</p>
								<p>The terms, <strong>system software, operating system, file management, and user interface</strong>, can all be used to refer to the program that you encounter when you first turn on the computer. A very common example is Microsoft Windows. Different terms are used for different reasons, so let's review each one to understand it more clearly.</p>
								<p>System software is a group of programs.</p>
								<p><strong>Operating System Software</strong> is the most basic software installed on your computer and it provides the overall structure function of the machine. The operating system software is always running in the background and it controls and directs the flow of information and data from within the computer.</p>
								
								<p>There are different kinds of operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Linux, or Mac OS. The operating system is an important part of the computer's basic makeup and acts as a "bridge" between your computer hardware and the application software. Windows, Windows 95, Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7 are all versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system.</p>
								<p><strong>File Management Software</strong> is a term that describes the programs you use to create, organize, delete and manage files and folders and the data stored within them. There is a whole unit in Jump Start where you will learn about using files and folders in more detail.</p>
								<p><strong>User Interface</strong> is used when talking about "the look and feel"ù of the interaction between the computer and the user. An easy example of this is your desktop. As you learned earlier, the desktop has icons, a taskbar, windows, a mouse pointer and more. All of these user friendly pieces together make up what is called a Graphical User Interface, or GUI for short.</p>
								
								<h4>Application Software</h4>
								<p><strong>Application software</strong> are programs that allow the user to do a particular task on the computer such as getting on the Internet, creating a document, playing a game, looking at a map, listening to music and many, many other things.</p>
								<p>The examples of application software are almost endless! Common examples are Google Maps, Microsoft Word, iTunes, Photoshop and so many more.</p>
								
								<h4>Hardware Definition and Types</h4>
								<p>The computer software you learned about in the previous section runs on computer hardware. <strong>Computer hardware</strong> means all of the physical parts of the computer. There are many types of hardware, but we will focus on these five:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Motherboard</li>
									<li>Processor (CPU)</li>
									<li>Hard Disk</li>
									<li>Input Devices</li>
									<li>Output Devices</li>
								</ol>
								
								<p>The <strong>motherboard</strong> (also called the main circuit board) is like the heart of the computer. Every component of the computer is linked to it in some way and it the motherboard that provides the power. You may have heard of <strong>chips or silicon chips</strong>. These are very tiny electronic devices that do much of the work of the computer as well as store data. The motherboard is where these devices are located as well as the computer's processor and the RAM (Random Access Memory - more about RAM in the next section).</p>
								<p>The <strong>processor</strong> (also called a microprocessor or a <strong>CPU</strong>, which is short for central processing unit) is like the brain of the computer and is located on the motherboard. It communicates with all of the other parts of the computer and it is the part of the machine that reads the instructions from the software and computer programs and processes information that has been input into the computer.</p>
								<p><strong>Hard disk</strong> (also called the <strong>hard drive</strong>) is a standard drive on the computer that is installed at the factory. It is a part of the permanent hardware of the computer and is not portable. Users can store large amounts of data here.</p>
								<p>The motherboard, CPU and hard drive are located in the tower on a desktop computer.</p>

<p>In a laptop computer, these components are located in the base, which is the bottom half of the laptop.</p>

								<p><strong>Input </strong> is any data entered into the computer and <strong>Input devices</strong> are equipment that put the data into a form a computer can process. That form is called <strong>digital information</strong> (which you will read about later). Examples of input devices are the keyboard, the mouse, scanners, microphones, game joysticks and digital cameras.</p>
								
								<img class="left space" src="images/computerbasics/inputdevices.jpg"/>
<hr>								<p><strong>Output </strong> is information produced by the computer and <strong>Output devices</strong> are equipment that translates the information (the <strong>digital information</strong>) that has been input into the computer and processed back into a form that can be read and understood by the user. Some common output devices include the monitor, printer, speakers, headphones, ear buds and portable drives.</p>

								<h4>Digital Language and Information</h4>
								
															
																<p>With input devices, like the keyboard, mouse, microphone, or digital camera, users put data into the computer. For the computer to be able to understand and use it, the data must be changed into a form that it can understand. That form is <strong>digital language</strong>. The word digit means number, so <strong>digital information</strong> is information converted into a language (or code) made up totally of numbers.</p>
								<p>Just like computers have a special vocabulary (as we talked about in the Introduction), the digital language computers use and understand is special too. It uses only two numbers, the numbers "1"ù and "0"ù and this digital language is called <strong>binary code</strong>.</p>
								<p>Computers are built around the simple idea that <strong>binary code</strong> can be represented by an electrical on/off switch that has just two settings, "on" or "off,"ù like an ordinary light switch that you can flip on or off. Zero represents the "off" state of the switch and one represents the "on" state of the switch.</p>


<p>So, switches hold <strong>digital information</strong>. A switch can either be on or off. If it is off, it represents a 0 and if it is on it represents a 1. If you line up switches together, the switches can be in a variety of states. All of them could be off or all of them could be on or every other one could be on, and so on.</p> 

<p>All stored information on your computer is stored in electrical switches. So, let's learn about what those switches are called and how they are lined up to represent information in a computer.</p>

<div class="twelve columns">					
								<h4>Bits and Bytes</h4>
								<p>Each switch is called a <strong>bit</strong> (short for <strong>b</strong>inary dig<strong>it</strong>).  </p>
								
<img class="left space" src="images/computerbasics/bit.jpg"/>
<hr>

<p>The collection of 8 switches is a called a <strong>byte</strong>. The word, byte, does not stand for anything in particular.</p>
	

<img class="left space" src="images/computerbasics/byte.jpg"/>
<hr>

							<p>By using the different combinations of on and off switches (bit configurations) in a byte, any letter, character, or number on the keyboard can be represented. But everyone must agree on what a certain bit configuration represents. The most widely accepted standard for representing characters with 8 bits is the <strong>A</strong>merican <strong>S</strong>tandard <strong>C</strong>ode for <strong>I</strong>nformation <strong>I</strong>nterchange (ASCII pronounced "as-kee").</p> 

<p>Below is a sample of ASCII binary codes:</p>

<img class="left space" src="images/computerbasics/askee.jpg"/>
<hr>

<p>Notice that the capital letter <strong>A</strong> and the lower case <strong>a</strong> have different combinations of on and off switches and are thus two totally different things to the computer. You must be careful to distinguish between upper case and lower case letters when you type an address on the Internet because browsers (application programs that navigate the Internet) are case sensitive.<p/>

<p>The concept of <strong>bytes</strong> and data size becomes important when you get to later sections about computer memory, data storage and beyond. </p>


							<p>All digital information is measured in bytes. But one little byte of data is really small, for example, one letter, number or symbol on your keyboard is one byte of data. Most data is measured in KB and bigger.</p>

<img class="left space" src="images/computerbasics/commonlyusedbytevalues.jpg"/>
<hr>

	
																<p>To sum this up, <strong>all digital information is zeros and ones and is measured in bytes</strong>. Bytes are groups of switches. Digital information is stored in switches, in bytes.</p>
