<p class="lead"><strong>Software companies bundle or package office types
            of software in suites or groups.</strong></p class="lead">
            <hr>


            <p>One of the advantages for the user is that the bundled programs
            within the suite have similar looking and behaving toolbars.
            Another advantage is that you can easily pass and share information
            between the bundled programs within the suite.</p>
        
        
            <p>There are a variety of brands of office software, including
            Microsoft Office for Windows, Microsoft Office for Mac, and Open
            Office, a free version. The DIDL has tutorials for Microsoft Office
            for Windows. Within Microsoft Office for Windows, there are many
            versions. Generally, the succession of versions is Microsoft Office
            2000, Microsoft Office XP, Microsoft Office 2003, Microsoft Office
            2007, and Microsoft Office 2010. As you learned in the Computer
            Basics section, the version on your computer shows when you open
            any of the programs within the office suite of programs.</p>

            <p>Although Microsoft Office 2000 through Microsoft Office 2003 had
            differences, a major change in the toolbars was launched with the
            Microsoft Office 2007 ribbon. The ribbon is in the same location as
            the toolbar; it is at the top of any open Office file such as
            document or spreadsheet. Instead of pull-down menus, however, the
            ribbon groups tasks into categories and has tabs for you to click
            to access different tasks and functions.</p>

            <p>Because the toolbar and the ribbon work differently, the DIDL
            tutorials are grouped into two categories, Classic Microsoft Word
            (toolbar and pull-down menus) for the versions prior to Microsoft
            Office 2007 and Microsoft Word 2007/10 (ribbon) for Microsoft
            Office 2007 and 2010. The same holds true for the other programs in
            the suite, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, and Publisher. The main
            difference between the toolbar and the ribbon is how the user gets
            to or accesses the task or function the user wishes to carry out.
            In many instances, the option boxes that provide the choices have
            not changed, just the method to reach the box (pull-down menu or
            ribbon).</p>

            <p>The DIDL tutorials are not designed to provide exact copies of
            each screen for each version. They are designed to empower you to
            learn with enough information to be able to work with your specific
            machine and your version of the software. Therefore, they point you
            in the right direction and promote problem solving. The more you
            are exposed to a variety of versions of the programs, the better
            you will handle the changes in new versions released in the
            future.</p>

<p>Most programs use toolbars. The toolbar is called the ribbon in
            the later versions of Microsoft Office. Toolbars are groups of
            related commands and tools represented with icons that are
            displayed on the screen for easy access.</p>

            <p>If you move your mouse over an icon in the toolbar and hover
            (wait a few seconds), the name of the tool will appear. By clicking
            on a tool, you activate that command.</p>

            <p>Because programs have many tools and commands, they are grouped
            together within the program. In some versions of programs, the
            &ldquo;most used&rdquo; tools and commands are seen on the toolbar. You can
            hide or show toolbars and you can customize your toolbars.</p>

            <p>However in those versions, you can become confused if a toolbar
            that you normally use disappears. To be an empowered user, it is
            important to understand how toolbars are commonly used, revealed,
            and grouped.</p>

            <p>Below are the Menu Options and Toolbars that you might see when
            you open the different versions of Microsoft Word:</p>

                    <p>In Microsoft Office 2010, the toolbar is called the
                    <strong>ribbon</strong>. The ribbon changes when you click
                    on one of the <strong>tabs</strong>. Within each tab, tools
                    and commands are put together in groups with names. There
                    are additional tools available in each group when you click
                    on the <strong>corner arrow</strong> in the bottom
                    right-hand corner of a group.</p>

                    <p>The <strong>File Menu</strong>, offers options such as
                    open, new, save, save as, print and close.</p>

                    <p>There is a <strong>Quick Access Toolbar</strong> that
                    can be customized by right clicking on the File Menu. It
                    provides handy access to commonly used tools such as undo
                    and redo. You can all other tools to this toolbar that you
                    commonly use.</p><img class="left" src=

                    <p>There is a <strong>Backstage View</strong> with the file

                    Microsoft Office. The Backstage View provides lots of
                    information and options that were not previously
                    available.</p>

                    <p>The example below is the Backstage View of the Save and

                    groups related tasks together instead of using drop-down

<h4>Default Program Options</h4>

            <p>Each program has defaults settings for the way the program
            operates. In the Classic Microsoft Office versions, these program
            options are found under the Tools Menu as Options. In the Microsoft
            Office 2007 and 2010 versions, Options are found under the Office
            Button or File Menu.</p>

            <p>You can view many defaults for a variety of tasks. It is
            important to locate these program options to see what kinds of
            things can be changed about the program with which you are
            working.</p>

            <p>For example, in a word processing program, you can learn how the
            Spelling and Grammar edit function works, and you can change the
            default settings.</p>

            <p>Below are examples of the default program options using
            Microsoft Word:</p><br>

            <p>As you learned in the Files and Folders section, computer
            storage is like having many large filing cabinets filled with many
            folders. All programs have a preset default filing cabinet and
            folder where your information is saved and stored if you do not
            specify a file or folder the first time you save a document.</p>

            <p>Remember in the Files and Folders section, the preset, default
            location for storing files in many Microsoft programs is in the
            <strong>My Documents</strong> or <strong>Documents</strong> folder.
            Also remember that this folder may be hidden under a user name
            because there can be more than one user utilizing a computer. Each
            user would have a My Documents or Documents folder. You may or may
            not want to use the default folder. Hopefully you have a clear idea
            about how you want to organize your folders and whether or not you
            want to use the default location.</p>

            <p>It is important to use the <strong>"Save As"</strong> option the
            first time you save a document. When you use "Save As", you can
            decide in what file or folder you want your information to be
            saved. Once you choose the file or folder where the document will
            be saved, the computer will keep saving the document to this
            location until you change it.</p>

            <p>The Save As box looks similar in all versions of Windows
            programs. You should think about three things when saving a
            document:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>What file or folder should I save it to?</li>

                <li>What shall I name the document?</li>

                <li>What format should I save it in?</li>
            </ol>

            <p>An empowered user will select the file or folder in which to
            store the file; you should name the file; and then you should
            choose the file format from the list of formats provided by the
            program. Remember, you will not type in the file extension; you
            will choose the file extension from the list.</p>

            <p>Below is a "Save As" box with the question areas
            highlighted:</p><img class="left" src=

            <hr>

            <p>It is extremely important to keep track of where your files are
            located, so it is extremely important to use <strong>Save
            As</strong>.</p>

<h4>Print Options Box</h4>

            <p>The <strong>Print Option Box</strong> is standard for all
            programs within an office suite. When you select Print, the box
            looks the same whether you are in word processing, spreadsheets,
            presentations, or any other program within the suite.</p>

            <p>There are several sections to the Print Option Box. The DIDL
            will explore printing options in all sections, so it is wise to
            learn about the sections in this box. The box has changed little
            from version to version until Microsoft Office 2010, where the
            <strong>Backstage View</strong> was introduced.</p>

            <p>To get to the Print Option box, you select Print from the File
            Menu or the Office Button.</p>
            <hr>

            <p><strong>The Print Option box has the following
            sections:</strong></p>

            <ul class="disc">
                <li>The <strong>Name</strong> or <strong>Printer</strong> gives
                you a selection box to choose the particular printer, a print
                converter such as a pdf converter, or if you want to print to a
                file.</li>

                <li>The <strong>Copies</strong> section allows you to choose
                the number of copies.</li>

                <li>The <strong>Collated</strong> section allows you to choose
                collating or not. <strong>Collating</strong> means ordering so
                that if you were printing two copies of a two page document,
                you could either print the two copies of page one first and
                then the two copies of page two, or you could print two
                "sets" of page one and two.</li>

                <li>The <strong>Print range</strong> or
                <strong>Settings</strong> section allows you to choose if you
                want to print the whole document, the current page (where the
                cursor is located), or a range of pages.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>First let's look at the <strong>Print Options Box</strong> for
            Classic Microsoft Office/Microsoft Office 2007.</p>

            <hr>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Printer Name</strong> gives you a selection box to
                choose the particular printer, a print converter such as a pdf
                converter, or if you want to print to a file.</li>

                <li><strong>Copies</strong> allows you to choose the number of
                copies.</li>

                <li>The <strong>Collate Box</strong> lets you choose whether or
                not you want the copies collated.</li>

                <li><strong>Print range</strong> allows you to choose if you
                want to print the whole document, the current page (where the
                cursor is located), or a range of pages.</li>
            </ol>
            <hr>
        </div>

        <p>Now, let's look at the <strong>Backstage Print Options
        Box</strong> for Microsoft Office 2010.</p>

        <h4>Backstage Print Options Box for Microsoft Office
        2010</h4><img class="left" src=

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Printer</strong> gives you a selection box to choose
            the particular printer, a print converter such as a pdf converter,
            or if you want to print to a file.</li>

            <li><strong>Copies</strong> allows you to choose the number of
            copies.</li>

            <li><strong>Settings</strong> allows you to choose if you want to
            print the whole document, the current page (where the cursor is
            located), or a range of pages.</li>

            <li><strong>Collated</strong> allows you to choose if you want the
            copies collated.</li>
        </ol>
