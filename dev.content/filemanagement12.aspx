							<h4>Print Screen</h4>

							<hr>
							<p class="lead">In Computer Basics, you learned a little bit about the Print Screen key and where to find it on your keyboard. If you do not know where the print screen key is on your keyboard or what it does, please review the Print Screen lesson in Computer Basics.<p>
							<p>You will use the <strong>Print Screen</strong> process to show what you have done in a task or exercise. This key is also helpful to use if you ever see an error message on your computer screen because you can take a screenshot of the error message.</p> <p>The Print Screen process is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tap the Print Screen Key, which puts a picture of the screen on the clipboard.</li>
<li>Paste the picture from the clipboard into a word processor.</li>
<li>Size the picture and print the page from the word processor.</li>

<h4>Short Review of the Print Screen Key</h4>
<br />
<br />
							<p>Recall there is a control key on your keyboard that takes a picture or screenshot of what is on your computer screen at the time you press it. It is called the <strong>Print Screen key</strong>.</p>
							<p>When you press the Print Screen key, a picture or screenshot of what is on your computer screen is captured. This action sends the screenshot to what is called the computer's clipboard, which is a holding area for any kind of data that you command the computer to copy.</p>
							<p>Now that the screenshot has been sent to the clipboard, in order to view it or to print it, you must place, or paste, the screenshot into a word processor.</p>

<h4>Clipboard Explanation</h4>
<br />
<br />

						
<p>Before we talk about Print Screen, let's learn a little more about the clipboard and how it works.</p>
							<p>The clipboard is a holding area where the computer puts data so it can be moved around inside a document or passed between different software programs.</p>
							<p>In other words, you can copy something to the clipboard and move it anywhere you want within that document. You can even copy data from a word processing program and paste it into a spreadsheet program, an email program or most any other kind of program.</p>
							<p>Now, let's talk in more detail about three commonly used commands: Copy, Cut and Paste.</p>

							<h5>Copy, Cut and Paste</h5>

							<hr>
							<strong>Copy</strong>
							<p>When you use the copy function to copy text, numbers, images or other data using your computer, you are literally making a copy of it so that you can place it somewhere else. When you copy, you leave the original text, numbers, images or other data in their original location and in their original state.</p>
							<p>In order to copy text or other data, you first highlight it with your mouse pointer or cursor. To highlight, you click and drag your mouse pointer or cursor across the text or data that you want to copy. You may also place the mouse pointer over the item and double click.</p>
							<p>Then you right click on the highlighted area and from the pop-up menu that appears, and you select copy. You may also do this using the keyboard command: copy command (CTRL C).</p>
							<p>Any data that you copy is placed on the clipboard and held there until you do something with it, like paste it in a new location.</p>
<hr>
							<strong>Cut</strong>
							<p>When you use the cut command, it deletes, erases or removes whatever text, numbers, images or other data you have selected.</p>
							
							<p>To select data to cut, you do the same thing as when you select data to copy. You highlight it using the mouse pointer or cursor and then right click on the highlighted area. From the pop-up menu that appears, you select cut. You may also do this using the keyboard command: cut command (CTRL X).</p>
							
							<p>Any data that you cut is placed on the clipboard and held there until you do something with it, like paste it in a new location.</p>
							
							<p>Typically, you can copy or cut only one thing at a time to the clipboard. A consecutive copy command replaces what was copied before it with the new information. It is the same for the cut command. Pictures or text can be placed on the clipboard as well.</p>
<hr>							
							<strong>Paste</strong>
							<p>To paste means to place data in a new location.</p>
							
							<p>To paste data, you place your mouse pointer or cursor in the spot where you want the data to go and then right click with your mouse. From the pop-up menu, you select paste and the data that was placed on the clipboard from either a copy or cut command is copied to the current program where your cursor is located.</p>
							
							<p>You may also paste data using a keyboard command: paste command (CTRL V)</p>

							<p>In the newer Microsoft Office Products, there is a clipboard task pane in which you can keep track of multiple items on the clipboard. This task pane may automatically pop up when copying, cutting, or pasting.</p>

<h4>Sizing & Printing Explanation</h4>
<br />
<br />
							
							<p>After capturing the picture of the screen and placing it on the clipboard, you must use a word processor to print or save it. <strong>You will use Word as the word processor to complete the tasks.</strong> </p>

<p>However, it is nice to become familiar with WordPad, a very simple word processor that comes with Windows under Accessories. Notepad is another free word processor under Accessories, but WordPad is better to use for printing the screenshot. We will start out using WordPad to familiarize you with it and later you can use Word.</p>
							
							<p>Open WordPad by clicking on the Start button, then Accessories, then WordPad. From the Edit Menu, select Paste. This will paste the picture of the screen you obtained from the Print Screen Key.</p>



<p>Often when you paste the picture of the screen, it is very large and extends past the margins in the word processor. Sometimes, you only have access to the left most sizing box around the picture because the other sizing boxes are out of sight as in the example below: 


<img class="space" src="images/filesandfolders/printscrsizing.jpg"/>
	

Click and drag on the sizing box you can see as many times as you need until it is within the margins as in the picture below:</p> 

<img class="space" src="images/filesandfolders/printscrsizing2.jpg"/><hr>

						<p>After you size the picture within the margins, you can select either Print or Save As from the File Menu.
							Printing the Screen in this manner will be used on your proficiency tasks.</p>

<h4>Description of the Two Kinds of Screenshots</h4>
<br />
<br />

								
							<p>Now that you have reviewed the basics about the print screen key, the clipboard, and the commands copy, cut and paste, let's learn more about the two kinds of screen captures or screenshots you can take.</p>

							<p>There are two kinds of screenshots or screen captures you can take:</p>
	


<ol>
								<li>The entire screen (Press PrtSc Key)

</li>
								<li>The active window only (Press Alt + PrtSc Key)		
</li>
							</ol>

<p>It is important that you know the difference between printing the entire screen and printing the active window. Printing the entire screen is just what it says, you are taking a picture of everything on the screen, the desktop, other open windows, and the active window you are working in. Printing the active window means you are taking a picture of just the window you are working in. <p>

<p>So the difference between printing the entire screen and printing only the active window is that you can see the desktop behind an open window when you are printing the entire screen, but when you are printing the active window, you can only see that window.</p>


<p>However, what if you have the active window maximized so it fills the entire screen? Remember from Computer Basics, that you can minimize and maximize windows. If you maximize a window it fills the entire screen and you cannot see the desktop or other open windows behind it. Therefore, you might wonder how you can tell the difference between printing the entire screen and printing the active window when the screen is maximized.</p>

<p>The difference is the taskbar at the bottom of the picture. When you print the entire screen and have the active window maximized, you can still see the taskbar. There are examples below: 					
																			
<hr>							
							<h5>Entire Screen</h5>
							
							<p>Pressing the <strong>Print Screen Key (PrtScr)</strong> on your keyboard captures what is on the entire screen and puts it on the clipboard. Below is a picture Wordpad after that is done.
</p>



<img class="left" src="images/filesandfolders/printscrentirescr1.jpg"/>							
							

<hr>

<p>Below is a picture of the entire screen where you do not see the desktop behind the open window because the open window is maximized. However you can see the taskbar at the bottom.<p>
<img class="left" src="images/filesandfolders/printscrentirescr2.jpg"/>	
<hr>

<p>The presence of the taskbar indicates that the entire screen has been printed even though you cannot see the desktop behind the open window.</p>
							
												<hr>							

							<h5>Active Window</h5>
							
							<p>If you have more than one window open on your computer at the same time, you can put the active window on the clipboard by holding down the <strong>ALT key</strong> while also pressing the Print Screen key (Prt Scr key), and the Shift key, if needed on your keyboard.</p>
							
							<p>The active window is the window in which the user is currently working and where the blinking cursor or mouse pointer is active.</p>

							<p>When you print the active window, just the window is captured and not what is behind the window. If the active window is maximized, you wouldn't see anything behind the window, but unlike printing the entire screen, the taskbar does not show at the bottom of the picture.</p>
							
											
							<p>Below is the picture of the active window pasted into Wordpad.							Notice that there is no taskbar at the bottom of the picture.</p>
