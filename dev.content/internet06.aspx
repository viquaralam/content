Along with Web and Internet security, there are many issues of privacy on the Web and Internet.</strong></p class="lead">

							<h4>What is meant by privacy?</h4><p> It is the amount and type of information that you choose to give or release on the Web and Internet. This means not only the information you give or release knowingly, with your permission, but also the information that is gathered without your direct permission.</p>	
							<p>This information can be personal information like your name, address, birth date, credit card information and social security number as well as information that is less directly personal, like the type of music you listen, the books you buy, the Web sites you visit and what you do while you are on the Web site.</p>
							<p>Many Internet sites collect personal information from users with online registrations, surveys, forms and purchases. Sites save and store this data for a number of reasons. Things a user view or buy can be stored so that on the next visit, that information is available for the user. It can also be used to recommend things to a user and can also be used to market or sell as well.</p>	
							<p>How do sites do this? Many sites use something called a cookie, HTTP cookie, or Web cookie. A <strong>cookie</strong> puts information on your hard disk from a Web site and information is collected from users. Cookies are often used to "remember"ù a user. This means things like Web site login information, name, previous purchases and things like that.</p>	
							<p>Most browsers let users decide to accept cookies or not. However, some Web sites are not usable if the cookies are rejected, especially some shopping sites. Shopping carts that use cookies do not work if cookies are rejected. Cookies present a potential loss of your privacy.</p>	
							<p>Some cookies do more. They track not only what a user does on the Web site that installs the cookie, but also what a user does on other sites and where they go on the Web. These are the cookies that are often called spyware, because they "spy"ù on a user's activity and report it back to the site that installed it.</p>	
							<p><strong>Profiling</strong> is collecting data in order to better target customers for sales or products or services. The companies who do this will use it themselves for their own products. They may also sell or share that information with other companies and marketers, possibly without the knowledge or consent of the user. The kind of data collected can include age, race, gender, income, education, address, car, employment, church and much more.</p>	
							<p><strong>Invasion of Privacy</strong> is a computer ethics (beliefs, morals) issue about the collection and use of this data about people without their knowledge or permission.</p>	
							<p><strong>EPIC</strong> is a public interest research center in Washington, D.C. It was established in 1994 to focus public attention on emerging civil liberties issues and to protect privacy, the First Amendment,and constitutional values. Read about the latest privacy issues at the Electronic Privacy Information Center by going to http://www.epic.org/. After looking around the site, go to an article concerning privacy issues by going to http://www.epic.org/reports/surfer-beware.html.</p>	
							<p>Like with Internet security, protecting your privacy on the Internet is largely up to you. An empowered user will install firewalls, be careful about personal information shared on Web sites and make use of software to help check the computer for unwanted, malicious cookies and programs.</p>
