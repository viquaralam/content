			<p class="lead"><strong>Different word processors and even different versions of a specific word processor store information a little differently.</strong></p class="lead">

<p>What this means for you, the user, is that you may run into some problems 
when you try to open and read a document using a word processor that is
different from the one that was used to create it. This is called an issue of
<strong>compatibility</strong>. This refers to how able different word processors and even 
different versions of the same word processor are able to work together to 
open, read and store documents created using different software.</p>

<p>Some versions of Microsoft Word do not read documents that have been created 
in other word processing programs such as Word Perfect. More importantly, older 
versions of Microsoft Word sometimes do not read the documents created in newer 
versions of Microsoft Word. Later versions add either the letter "x"ù or an 
"m"ù to the file extension, to show that it is an XML file (see Internet 
section). There are add-ins that can be installed on your computer to help with
 compatibility for many versions and types of word processing software.</p>

<p>All word processors are able to save the document in a different format. If
 you select the <strong>Save As</strong> option you can select not only the storage location, but
 also the format. When you choose save as, you choose the file extension for the
 format that you want to save the document in. In other words, Microsoft Word
 has the capability of storing a document in Word Perfect format, a PDF format
and others. Newer versions of Microsoft Word have the capability of saving a
 document in an older formats or versions of Word.</p>

<p>However, there is a common, universal format that all word processors can 
read. This format is called <strong>RTF, or Rich Text Format</strong>. All word processors have
the capability of saving a document in rtf format with the file extension, rtf.
 Some of the original formatting may be lost if you select rtf format, but for
the most part, the document is in a readable, usable format. However,
fixed-layout, read-only formats such as PDF and XPS (see Internet section)
retain all formatting and can be created using Save As with add-in components
to some of the newer versions of word processors.</p>

<h4>Styles</h4>

<p>You will not be required to use styles in your practical tasks. This
information on styles is here just to make you aware of styles. The empowered
word processor user knows how to use styles.</p>

<p>Almost all of us have used word processors and encountered strange
formatting effects, which make us feel like we do not have full control of our
document. If you have encountered this, you may be struggling against styles.
 In modern word processors, you do not have full control! Styles are preset
format elements that have been assigned a name. There is a default style in
place when you create a new document whether you want it or not.</p>

<p>The alternative to using style for formatting your documents is to format
each word, phrase, paragraph, or page individually. Using style saves you time, 
protects document consistency and reduces the time it takes to change a 
document's total appearance.</p>

<p>Styles define and set the appearance of your document: the arrangement of
 text on the pages, the shape of the paragraphs, the characteristics of the
letters, the use of lines and borders etc. All of the style element selections
 are stored together in one place in the document, whereas direct formatting is 
spread throughout the document.</p>

<p>You can change the  "look"ù of a style to meet your needs. More
 importantly, HTML recognizes styles. In other words, if you use styles in
creating a document, you do not have to make major changes to the document in
order to publish it on the Internet. With the Internet growing as a standard
means of communication, it is becoming increasingly more important to 
understand styles.</p>

<p>Most word processors operate in the same way and have a default style
selection. Sometimes you are given a choice of preset, preformatted styles in
the form of a <strong>template</strong> (a template is a pattern) that has specific styles
associated with it. If you do change the formatting of a style element (one of
 the features, like font or spacing) all text formatted with that <strong>style element</strong>
will be reformatted automatically. In addition, there is usually a selection of
 preformatted styles in a style gallery and can be applied automatically to your
document whenever you wish.</p>

<p>Read about using styles in Help. To make use of styles, first decide the
font style and size you want to use for your main or primary text. Then, make
the change to the style defined as "normal."ù This is different from merely
changing the font and size from the tool bar because it changes the default
font for the whole document. Make any additional changes to any other
 predefined styles through the same procedure. When you enter text in a
document, select either normal or a heading style for the line and begin
typing. The word processor makes assumptions about returning to normal style,
one of them being when you begin a new paragraph, or enter a blank line. It is
those assumptions that cause the mysterious effects with which you fight.</p>

<p>But do remember, the preset, default styles in your word processor are
likely fine for most of the documents you create. Most users change from the
preset, default styles when there is a particular reason.</p>

<h4>Guidelines for Creating Documents with Respect to Style</h4>

<p>Use the following guidelines when creating documents so that your documents
can be easily published on the Internet. Remember:</p>

<ul class="disc">

<li>Decide on a text font size and font style for the whole document and
define it utilizing styles. Within styles, this is called "Normal"ù or
 "Body text."ù</li>

<li>If you want any part of your document to have different font or spacing
other than what you have defined for "Normal" or "body text,‚" create a
new style element with that change and select the new style for that part. Do
not embed font changes within the document. In other words, do not highlight
text and change the font for the highlighted text.</li>

<li>Determine distance between paragraphs by defining the line spacing
 "before and after"ù within the style instead of adding blank lines between 
paragraphs.</li>

<li>When creating numbered or bulleted lists create a new style entry that
is formatted with numbers or bullets.</li>

<li>Avoid the use of tabs. Either define a style that is indented or use
tables to put text in columns.</li>
</ul>
