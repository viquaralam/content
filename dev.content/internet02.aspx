								<p class="lead"><strong>Now that you understand that the Web is a part of the Internet and that you access the Web through the Internet, let's learn a little bit about the text (the printed words) you see and read when you are looking at information on the Web.</strong></p class="lead">
								<hr>
								</p><H4>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</h4></p>
								<p>Whatever you see and read on the Web was put there by a computer user. For example, the color of the text, the <strong>font</strong> (how the letters look - also called type or typesetting), the space between words and sentences, where a picture is placed, and everything that you see was chosen by someone before it was put on the Web.</p>
								<p>So, in order for the viewer to see things on the Web the way the user intends, the user must also input instructions for how the text and other items are to be displayed. These instructions are called <strong>Hypertext Markup Language</strong> (<strong>HTML</strong> for short). HTML is the standard protocol for formatting and displaying documents on the Web. It is the formatting language or code used for Web documents and it tells Web browsers how to display the information on your computer screen.</p>
								<p>So how does HTML work? Think of it this way, while people use words to speak a language, the language of HTML is made up of tags. <strong>Tags</strong> are used on different parts of the document to tell the browser how to display it. For example, the information in a tag will instruct the browser to display the title of a document in big, bright purple text that blinks.</p>
								<p>Basically, HTML contains tags that surround text and the tags describe how the text should be displayed on the screen. Because browsers must be able to adjust to different computers, screens and windows and HTML must be able to adjust to different browsers, HTML must be flexible.</p>
								<p>HTML will display fonts that are already loaded on a user's computer and substitute fonts if the original font is not available. Therefore, the information on a Web page can look different, depending on the size of the window you are using to view it, the fonts that are located on your computer and the browser you are using. For example, if your computer does not have the font for Chinese letters, your computer will display the text using a default font that is on your computer.</p>
								<p>What if you want to print a document from the Web? Because of HTML, documents may not always keep the same formatting that you see on the Web when you print the document. However, there is a way for you to keep the format of documents that you see on the Web when you print or email them. Let's learn more about how you can do this.</p>

							<h4>PDF, XPS and FTP</h4>
							<p>As you already learned, H T M L is the standard protocol for formatting and displaying documents on the Web. But because it is so flexible, when you try to print or email a document from the Web, the format may not stay the same as you see it on the Web. If you want to keep the format that you see, you can convert (which means change) the format of the document from HTML to another format. The two formats that do this easily are called <strong>PDF</strong> format and <strong>XPS</strong> format.</p>	
							<p><strong>Portable Document Format (PDF)</strong> is a print format that will preserve or "fix"ù all of the fonts, formatting, colors, and graphics of any document as they are set in the original and are supposed to print. It does not matter what format or program was used to originally create the document; when you convert the document to PDF, it will be saved in its original format.</p>	
							<p>Once a PDF file is created, a user must view or print the PDF document using AdobeÆ AcrobatÆ Reader&#x2122;. There is a basic version of AdobeÆ Reader&#x2122; which is free and easy to <strong>download</strong> (which means to copy data from the Web or Internet to your computer) to your computer.</p>
							<p>If you want to create or change a PDF file, you must purchase AdobeÆ AcrobatÆ, or other software that creates PDF files, or download an add-in that allows you to save a printout in PDF format. PDF files are commonly found and shared on the Internet. Many newer versions of Microsoft Word or other word processing software have the option to save a document as a PDF built in. Remember, once a document is converted to PDF, it is not easy to make changes to the text or to the format.</p>
														<p>In the section on Word Processing, you will learn how to create a PDF and XPS. If you do not already have the ability to create PDF on your computer, you will need to download the CutePDF writer or some other program like it at that time.</p>
							<p><strong>XML Paper Specification (XPS)</strong> is another print, fixed-layout format that preserves document formatting and cannot be easily changed. You can select this format when saving a document and the document can be viewed and printed by a browser. The format is available in Microsoft Office 2007 and add-ins can be downloaded to save in this format for other versions. Once a document is converted to XPS, it is not easy to make changes to the text or to the format.</p>
							<p>Any document that is ready to print can be converted to PDF or XPS formats. There are two benefits to converting documents to a PDF or XPS format. It allows the user keep the original document format when viewing, printing or sending by email and the viewer cannot easily change the document.</p>
							<p><strong>Uploading</strong> (which means to transfer data or files from your computer to another computer through the Internet) typically requires special software unless the site you are on, like this one, has already set up the process that allows you to upload files. The software that transfers files from one computer to another through the Internet is called <strong>File Transfer Protocol (FTP) software</strong>.</p>
 

<p>Many browsers have add-on applications that accomplish uploading. Because you must have permission to upload files to another computer, you probably will not be uploading files to other computers unless you are given permission and asked to do so. Email can be used to send files to other people through email attachments. You will be learning about email attachments later in this section.</p>

<h5>Creating a PDF File</h5>

<p>A <strong>PDF File</strong> (Portable Document Format) can be read by anyone with AdobeÆ; AcrobatÆ; Reader&#x2122;, a free program that can be easily downloaded from the Internet.</p>

<p>Adobe&reg; Acrobat&reg; is the original program that allows you to create and work with PDF files. Because PDF format has become so popular, many programs have incorporated the ability to Save As or Publish a document in pdf file format. If that option is not available in the program you are using, you can either purchase or download a free program that converts your printout to pdf format. Because there are many options, explore and learn about the options you have to create pdf files.</p> 

<p>For newer versions of the Microsoft suite of software programs, the easiest option is to select Save As or Publish when saving the document and then choose PDF as the file type.</p>

<p>Let's look at the options in Microsoft for saving or publishing a document in the pdf file format.</p>


<p><strong>Save as a PDF</strong></p>

<p>When you save the document, you choose the type of file in which you would like it saved. Click on the down facing arrow in the space for <strong>Save as type:</strong> as in the picture below.</p>

<p><strong>Publish as a PDF</strong></p>

<p>Some programs and some versions of programs have an option to publish as PDF. This option is typically found through the File Menu as in the picture below: </p>

<img class="img-wrap style1" src="images/internet/publishpdf.png"/>
<hr>

<p>If the Save As or Publish options are not available in the program you are using, you can also buy a variety of programs or download a freeware program (no cost to you) such as CutePDF Writer from <a href="http://cutepdf.com">http://cutepdf.com</a> that converts what you want to print to a pdf file from the Print Menu.</p>
 
<p>Once the program is installed on your computer, you can select the pdf converter from the Print Menu of any program (as in the pictures below) and the converter prompts you for a file name to save in pdf format.</p>
