Empowerment Concepts, LLC was created to provide <b>Self-Directed Learning Systems (SDLS)</b> that empower. In self-directed learning (SDL), the individual takes the initiative and the responsibility for what occurs by selecting, managing, and assessing their own learning activities. The system provides the administration, documentation, tracking, and reporting of self-directed learning. 

<p> 

The first of these systems is the <b>Digital Information Driver's License (DIDL)</b> which empowers students with a foundational understanding of the way digital information works. Because students in web-based learning environments are largely dependent on technology as a delivery system, they must be able to traverse the technology before they can begin to learn the specific curriculum through that delivery system.</p>

<p>The <b>Empowerment Concepts Self-directed Learning System (EC SDLS)</b> is uniquely designed with an <b>Empowerment Rationale for Curriculum Design</b> (Hadley 2009). Using this rationale as a basis for designing curricula ensures a focus on mastering critical concepts and developing confidence in the student’s ability to create solutions instead of categorizing a level of performance with a grade.</p>

<p>The <b>Empowerment Rationale</b> assumes that certain skills can be broken down, practiced, mastered, and certified. The design is a <b>mastery design</b>, providing the individual with multiple opportunities to show competency, and utilizes <b>authentic assessment</b>, which reflects learning that can be immediately applied in real situations. It also produces a <b>certification of mastery</b> upon completion.</p>

                                      years of service, she retired from a tenured position in the Department of Curriculum
                                      and Instruction at Angelo State University in San Angelo, Texas where she taught

                                  Dr. Hadley spent fifteen years at the university refining the curriculum for the
                                  Digital Information Driver's License,</span> determining
                                      which experiences, terminology, and skills should be included in the basic computer
                                      skills curriculum. The goal was to define only the essential skills that give control
                                      to the user, so that a manageable, but sleek set of skills emerged. In the process,
                                      she researched the basis for creating an empowering methodology.</span></p>
