<h3>Section Review</h3>
								<hr>
								<p class="lead">The Computer Basics section has introduced you to basic terms and concepts that explain how your computer works and what you see when you start it up. Knowing this information empowers you over the computer and its programs so you can use them more powerfully.</p>
								
								<p><strong>Key Concepts include the following:</strong></p>
								<ul class="disc">
								<li>Hardware includes the physical parts of the computer.</li>
								<li>Software is defined as the programs that instruct the computer in what to do.</li>
								<li>There are two major types of software: system software and applications software.</li>
								<li>Windows is your system software, operating system, or file management program.</li>
								<li>All information must be digitized (turned into zeros and ones) by input devices in order  <br />to be processed by the computer and returned back to understandable information <br /> by output devices.</li>
								<li>The clipboard is a holding area for any kind of data that you command the computer to copy.</li>
								<li>Computer memory is temporary and lasts only as long as the computer is powered on.</li>
								<li>Secondary Storage is where you save programs, information and data more  <br />permanently on your computer.</li>
								<li>Storage devices have directories.</li>
								</ul>
								<br />
								<p>Default locations are locations on your computer where data is automatically stored if you, the user, don't instruct the computer to store the data somewhere else. However, you can set up your own storage areas and do not have to use the default locations.</p>
								<p>It is important to know the file extension of a file. You do not have to enter the file extension, because the program you are using will automatically put one on for you.</p>
