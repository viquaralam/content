<h4>Windows and Window Elements</h4>
<br />
<br />
		

<p>When you open a program, it opens into what is called a window and you will see the program name listed in the taskbar. Let's learn more about these windows - what you see in them and how to manage them.</p>
																
						<p>A <strong>window</strong> is a square portion on the screen surrounded by a border with a title bar at the top of it. In some versions of Windows when the window fills the entire screen, the title bar disappears unless you move the mouse to the top area of the window when it reappears.</p>
								<p>The <strong>title bar</strong> is at the top of the window. It tells you the name of the program. If you open a document, spreadsheet, etc. it will also tell you the name of the document or if the document does not have a name yet, it may say untitled, document, worksheet, etc.</p>
								<p>The title bar also contains three buttons on the top right. These three buttons, called <strong>system  buttons</strong>, allow the user to change the size of the window, close it or leave it open but remove it from the being seen on the computer screen. You will learn about them later in this section.</p>
								<img class="img-wrap style1" src="images/computerbasics/titlebar.png" alt="">

<hr>																<p>In the above example in the middle of the title bar, you can see that the open program is called <i>WordPad</i> and that the document has not name yet, so it is referred to as Document. In some versions of Windows, this information is on the left side of the title bar.</p>
								<p>On the right side of the title bar, you see the three buttons for sizing the window.</p>
	
<hr>
							
								<p>When you open a program or document, the window may be divided into sections or <strong>window panes</strong>. Do not worry if the window you open does not have a window pane.</p>
								<p><strong>Scroll Bars</strong> indicate there is more information to view. Some windows have a scroll bar on either the side or the bottom or both and some do not. Scroll bars let you know there is more information to read or to view. If you do not see a scroll bar, it means you can see all of the information.</p>
								
								<p>Click and drag on the arrow or the bar itself to either scroll up, down, right, or left.</p>
								<hr>
								<h5>Window With Panes</h5>
															<img class="img-wrap style1" src="images/computerbasics/windowpanes.png" width="699" height="518" alt="">
								<br />
								<br />
								<p>The above window has two panes, a left one and a right one.The panes may be the same size or different sizes. In this example, each pane has a scroll bar. But, not every window will have a scroll bar. </p>								<hr>
								
												
<h5>Using the Buttons on the Title Bar</h5>
															<p>Let's learn more about the buttons in the top right-hand corner of the window in the title bar and what each one does.</p>
								
								<ol>
									<li>The <strong>Minimize </strong>button looks like a dash and when clicked hides the window from view on the screen and places it as a button on the taskbar. The window and the program are still open, just hidden from the user's view on the screen. To see the window again, click with your mouse on the button on the taskbar.</li>
									<li>The <strong>Maximize</strong> button looks like a box and when clicked makes the window to fill the whole screen. If the open window is already filling the whole screen (meaning it is already maximized), then the middle button looks like two boxes and is called a restore button. The restore button returns a window to the size it opened it opened in at first.</li>
									<li>The <strong>Close</strong> button looks like an "X". It shuts the window down and when clicked removes it from the desktop and the taskbar.</li>
								</ol>

<h4>The Task Bar</h4>
								<br />
								<br />
	


<p>Remember from the <i>Booting Up, User Interface, Desktop, and Mouse</i> section, the taskbar is the strip at the bottom of the screen. The middle of the taskbar is the section that shows you the tasks you have opened. In come versions of Windows, icons that are regularly used can be pinned or anchored on the taskbar in this area for quick access. When you right click on an icon, the menu gives you the option to pin or unpin an icon to the taskbar.</p>							<p>You can see in the example below that the user has minimized three windows. The box around each icon means the windows and porgrams are still open, but not seen on the computer screen. No box around the icon means it is pinned to the taskbar.</p>
								<img class="img-wrap style1" src="images/computerbasics/taskbar.png" width="699" height="225" alt="">
    <br />
    <br />
    <h4>Windows 8.1 Taskbar</h4>
    <p>Windows 8.1 taskbar allows you to pin (anchor) regularly used icons to the taskbar. in the example below, the Start Button (1), the Internet Explorer broswer icon (2), and the File Explorer icon (3) are all pinned to the takbar. The box around the Mozilla Firefox icon (4) indicates that Mozilla Firefox is opened in a window but the window is minimized. YOu know the icons Internet Explorer (2) and File Explorer (3) are pinned because they do not have a box around them, indicating a minimized window. If you click on the MOzilla Firefox (4) icon to open it up and then close it, it will disappear from the taskbar unless it is also pinned to the taskbar.</p>

								<p>Windows Vista versions that include Aero (visual effects) have a Flip 3D option on the taskbar that allows you to flip through the windows that have been minimized in a 3D stack. Click on Flip 3D button and scroll forward or backwards through the stack using the keyboard arrows or the scroll wheel on your mouse. Wait until you have some practice before you attempt to use this feature.</p>

								<h4>Moving a Window</h4>
								<br />
								<br />
								<p>As you learned, the system buttons in the title bar allow you to control the window by maximizing, minimizing or closing it. If you want to <strong>move</strong> the window on your screen you can do so by clicking and dragging.</p>
								<p>You learned about click and drag in <i>Booting Up, User Interface, Desktop, and Mouse</i> section. </p>
								<p>In order to move a window on your screen, put the mouse pointer in the title bar and then click with your mouse and drag the window where you want to move it on the screen.</p>
								<p>When the screen is where you want it, release the button. You can move a window as many times as you want.</p>

								<h4>Changing the Size of a Window and Window Pane</h4>
								<br />
								<br />
								<p>As you learned, you can control the size of a window using the system buttons to maximize it or to restore it. But if you want even more control over the size of the window, you can <strong>size</strong> it using your mouse pointer.</p>
								<p>To do this, move the mouse pointer to any edge (or border) of the window until the pointer turns into a double-headed arrow.</p>
								<p>Using the double headed arrow, click and drag on the border of the window to size or shape it, making the window bigger or smaller, as you wish.</p>
														

						<img class="img-wrap style1" src="images/computerbasics/sizing-a-window.png" width="198" height="163" alt="">
	
<hr>							
								<p>You can also size a <strong>window pane</strong> (if you have window panes) by moving the cursor to the border of the pane until the cursor changes into a double arrow and dragging to make it larger.</p>
																			


							
							<p>In the picture below, the left side pane is too small to see the folder names.</p>
								
	
							<img class="img-wrap style1" src="images/computerbasics/PaneTooSmall.jpg" width="699" height="518" alt="">
						<hr>																				
									<p>In the picture below, the pane is sized to see the folder names. </p>
						
								<img class="img-wrap style1" src="images/computerbasics/PaneSized.jpg" width="699" height="518" alt="">	
						<hr>								
																				<p>Whenever you see a folder or file name with three dots after it (like Empowerment Mo... in the picture below), you must size the field in order to see the rest of the file name. A field is the space allowed for information. Move the cursor or mouse pointer to the border of the&nbsp;<strong>Name</strong> field at the top of the column. Then, click and drag to the right to show the rest of the file name.</p>


								<img class="img-wrap style1" src="images/computerbasics/FieldTooSmall.jpg" alt="">
						<hr>								
																				
								<p>The picture below shows the entire file name, Empowerment Model.doc, after the <strong>Name</strong> field has been sized.</p>

<h4>Pop-Up Menu</h4>
								<br />
								<br />
								<p>A <strong>Pop-up menu</strong> is a menu that pops open into view when you click on a mouse button or move the mouse pointer over an area in the screen.</p>

								<img class="img-wrap style1" src="images/computerbasics/popupmenu.png" width="699" height="518" alt="">
								<br />
								<br />
								
								<p>The pop-up menu in this example is boxed with a dashed box.</p>	
								<p>This pop-up menu was opened when the user put the mouse pointer on the icon for the C: Drive and then right clicked the mouse.</p>
								<p>This pop-up menu offers the user many choices for working with the C:Drive on their computer.</p>
