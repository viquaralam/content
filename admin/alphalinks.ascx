		 * Dan Clem, 3/7/2007: As currently written, the control's Letter property must be accessed from the
		 * PreRender method of the calling page, NOT the Page_Load method of the calling page.
		 * I tried changing this method in the control to Page_Init in an attempt to make the value accurate
		 * from the calling page's Page_Load method, but this resulted in a one-off error, where the control showed the
		 * correct selected value, but the page was filtering the user list based on the prior click.
		 * 
		 * So based on my current understanding, I want to use Page_Load in the control and Page_PreRender in the calling page
		 * 
		 * 
		 * 
		 * Dan Clem, 3/6/2007.
		 * This is my first user control / .ascx file.
		 * It took me a while to figure out how to get a handle on what letter the user clicked.
		 * I found the answer to this (using command arguments with that weird DataBind syntax) at
		 * http://www.codeproject.com/aspnet/letterbasedpaging.asp.
		 * 
		 * This DataBind syntax was somewhat LESS than intuitive. >:[]
		 * 
		 * Note that most samples I've found check for POSTBACK in the pageload event to set initial values.
		 * I've chosen to check for ViewState instead, because that's just how it played out.
		 * I have no idea whether this is considered standard usage.
		 * 
		 * On a related note, you may notice that I have a SETTER for the LETTER.
		 * Reason being: I want to make this page available through a querystring link with a letter in it.
		 * I haven't tested this yet, but I'm hoping that I can initialize to an original querystring value.
